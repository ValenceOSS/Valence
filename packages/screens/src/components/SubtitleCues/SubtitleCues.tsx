/**
 * Subtitles drawn by the application rather than by the thing playing the film.
 *
 * A browser draws these itself, given a `track` element on the video it is playing. There is no
 * video element when the operating system is doing the playing — the picture is behind the window,
 * and nothing behind the window knows what this application's subtitles are or where its controls
 * sit. So the file is read here and the lines are drawn as part of the page, over the picture, with
 * the same preferences a browser would have been handed.
 *
 * It moves out of the way of the controls when they are up, which a browser only manages through a
 * positioning hint that has to be rewritten into the file. Here it is where the line is put.
 *
 * A track that is a script is asked for as lines that kept where they go and what they were dressed
 * in, and anything else — or any track on a server that cannot answer that — is read as WebVTT and
 * dressed in nothing, which is the same thing this drew before scripts were understood.
 *
 * Whose styling wins depends on what a line is. A sign is the author's: a shop front, a caption, a
 * note in the corner of the frame, drawn where and how the script asked so that it reads as part of
 * the picture. Dialogue is the viewer's, and takes the caption preferences they set — those exist so
 * that somebody who needs large lettering on a solid ground can read at all, and a file is not
 * entitled to overrule that. Dialogue is sized by the picture's height, so it grows with the player
 * on a large or dense screen rather than staying the size of the page's text.
 *
 * @param src - The subtitle file to read as WebVTT.
 * @param cuesSrc - Where to ask for the same track as styled lines, for a track that has them.
 * @param atSeconds - Where playback is up to, offset included.
 * @param style - How this viewer likes captions drawn.
 * @param isLifted - Whether the controls are up and dialogue should sit above them.

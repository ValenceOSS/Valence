/**
 * The watch party, from the player's own bar: who is in it and what they may do while it is running,
 * and the way to start one while it is not.
 *
 * It belongs beside the other things a viewer reaches for mid-film rather than in a panel of its own
 * hung over the picture, which is what it was — a party is one of the controls, not a second screen.
 *
 * @param party - The party as the server last described it, or null while there is none.
 * @param meConnectionId - Which member this tab is.
 * @param waitingFor - Whoever the room is waiting for before it can play.
 * @param invitation - The address that puts somebody else in this party.
 * @param isDisabled - Whether the control is inert, as it is while a session is starting.
 * @param onOpen - Called to start a party around what is playing.
 * @param onLeave - Called to leave the party.
 * @param onRemove - Called to put somebody out of the party.
 * @param onSetPassword - Called to put a password on the party, or to take it off.
 * @param people - Everybody with an account here, to be asked along.
 * @param onAsk - Called to ask one of them along.
 * @param isHidden - Whether the bar this sits in has gone, which takes the panel with it.
 * @param onSetRole - Called to change somebody's role.
 * @param onLoosen - Called to change what everybody in the party may do.
 * @param onCopyInvitation - Called to put the invitation on the clipboard.
 * @param onOpenChange - Called as the menu opens or closes, so the bar stays put while it is open.

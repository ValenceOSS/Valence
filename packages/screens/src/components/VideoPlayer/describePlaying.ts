/**
 * Names what is playing, in the order somebody looking for it would say it: the programme, where in
 * it this is, what this one is called, and when it is from.
 *
 * An episode named by its own title alone is unidentifiable — half the television ever made has an
 * episode called Pilot — and a programme named without the episode is no better. Both are said,
 * separated rather than run together, so the eye can stop at whichever part it was looking for.
 *
 * The year is bracketed rather than separated, because it qualifies the thing immediately before it
 * rather than standing as a fact of its own. Anything missing is left out rather than drawn as a
 * gap: a film has no series and an unmatched item may have no year, and neither should read as
 * something having failed to load.
 *
 * @param media - What is playing.
 * @returns What to call it.

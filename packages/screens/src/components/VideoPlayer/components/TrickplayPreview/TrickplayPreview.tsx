/**
 * Shows where the pointer is while somebody scrubs, with the frame there if there is one. The frame
 * comes from the sprite sheet built when the item was scanned — one image holding every thumbnail,
 * so the right frame is found by offsetting the background rather than by fetching anything.
 *
 * The time is always shown and the frame is not. Sheets are built in the background, a position
 * part-way through a sheet still being written has no thumbnail, and both used to remove the whole
 * panel — so the one piece of information that never needs a sheet went missing along with the one
 * that does, and hovering the bar appeared to do nothing at all. An empty frame of the right size
 * also keeps the panel from changing shape as sheets arrive.
 *
 * @param trickplay - The sheet and how its frames are arranged, or nothing where none is built yet.
 * @param seconds - Where the pointer is.

/**
 * One decision in the form, as the platform's own menu. Written once here because the dialog asks
 * three questions of exactly the same shape, and three hand-built menus would drift apart.
 *
 * The answer takes whatever room the question leaves and sits against the right edge of it, which
 * on any normal panel is room enough to read it whole. Shortening only happens where it genuinely
 * will not fit.
 *
 * It is claimed rather than merely allowed. `OptionMenu` holds its trigger against shrinking, which
 * suits the icons it was built around; overriding that to let it shrink let it collapse to a letter
 * and an ellipsis while most of the row stood empty, since a flex item told it may shrink and given
 * no reason to grow takes the smallest width its content permits.
 *
 * @param label - What is being decided.
 * @param options - The choices.
 * @param value - The choice in force.
 * @param onSelect - Called with the choice made.
 * @returns The menu.

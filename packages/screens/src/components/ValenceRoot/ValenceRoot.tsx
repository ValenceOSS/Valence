/**
 * Which of the two applications this is: the ordinary one, or the small one for when there is no
 * server.
 *
 * The choice is made out here rather than inside the ordinary application, and that is the whole
 * reason this exists. Deciding it further in would mean the ordinary application mounting first —
 * opening a socket, asking whether the server has been set up, asking who is watching — and every
 * one of those failing on the way to drawing something that never needed them. Choosing before any
 * of it mounts means offline costs nothing and asks nobody.
 *
 * Coming back is the moment anything watched on the aeroplane is told to the server, because it is
 * the first moment there is a server to tell.
 *
 * The chosen theme is put on the document from here, because this is the outermost thing either
 * application has in common — and from the one screen that is drawn before this exists, which is a
 * client asking which server is yours.
 *
 * @param initialTitle - What this instance is called.

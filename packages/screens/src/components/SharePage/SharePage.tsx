/**
 * What somebody sent a link to, for a guest who is not signed in and has no profile to record
 * anything against. Where they got to is held here for as long as the page lives and nowhere else,
 * since there is nobody to hold it for.
 *
 * A guest cannot be told that their link has been withdrawn: the realtime feed wants an account, and
 * a link is deliberately never a live feed of the household. So this asks instead, while something
 * is playing, and takes the picture away the moment the answer is that the link has ended — rather
 * than letting a guest watch out whatever the buffer holds and then reporting it as a fault in the
 * stream, which is a decision somebody made described as a failure.
 *
 * A shared book is read the same way, in the reader a household uses, and the link is asked about
 * while it is open just as it is while something plays.
 *
 * Asking only while playing is the point: a guest reading the page has nothing to interrupt, and the
 * screen they are on asks for itself when it opens.
 *
 * @param name - What this instance is called.
 * @param askEveryMilliseconds - How often to check the link still works while something is playing.

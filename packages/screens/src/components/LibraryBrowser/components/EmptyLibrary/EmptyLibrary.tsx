 * server with nothing scanned anywhere. Only the last is a reason to talk about scanning.
 *
 * @param search - What was searched for, where anything was.
 * @param libraryName - The library being looked at, where one is chosen.
 * @param hasContentElsewhere - Whether any other library has anything in it.
 * @param canManage - Whether whoever is reading this could do anything about it.
 * @param onManage - Told that they would like to, where they can.

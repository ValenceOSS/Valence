/**
 * Everything this viewer has asked the server to prepare, raised over whatever they were looking at.
 *
 * Checking on a download is looking in on work rather than going somewhere: you glance at it, see
 * that the film you asked for an hour ago is ready, and carry on with what you were doing. Closing
 * it puts back the page underneath, which is what a glance should do.
 *
 * It exists only where files can be kept. See `canKeepFiles`. Which is also why going offline is
 * offered from here: a client that can hold nothing has nothing to be offline with, so the switch
 * belongs beside the things it would show.
 *
 * @param isOpen - Whether the address has it open.
 * @param onClose - Told it was dismissed.

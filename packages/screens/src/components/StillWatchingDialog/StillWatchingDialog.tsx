/**
 * Asks whether anybody is still there, before playing another episode that nobody chose.
 *
 * Shown instead of starting the next episode rather than over the top of one already playing, which
 * is what makes it worth doing at all: nothing is transcoded for an empty room, and nothing is
 * written to continue-watching for an episode nobody saw. Answering carries on from exactly where
 * the run left off.
 *
 * The countdown is shown rather than hidden, because a prompt that closes a film without warning is
 * worse than one that says it is about to.
 *
 * @param isOpen - Whether the question is being asked.
 * @param title - The episode waiting to be played, so the answer is an informed one.
 * @param secondsToAnswer - How long before it gives up on its own.
 * @param onCarryOn - Called when somebody says they are still there.
 * @param onGiveUp - Called when nobody answers in time.
 * @returns The dialog.

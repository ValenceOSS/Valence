/**
 * Gathers everything wrong with this server into one ordered list, worst first: a service that cannot
 * be reached, jobs that failed, resources under pressure, streams about to stall, and libraries
 * nobody has scanned yet. Each carries the panel it can be dealt with in, so the banner can send an
 * administrator straight there rather than describing where to look.
 *
 * @param overview - What the server reports about itself, or null before it has answered.
 * @param monitor - The live readings, or null before any have arrived.
 * @param libraries - The libraries configured.
 * @param sessions - What is being watched at the moment.
 * @param history - Recent processor readings, used to tell a spike from sustained load.
 * @param encoderHistory - The same for the graphics encoder.
 * @param requests - What the server last heard from the requests service, where requesting is on.
 * @returns The concerns, broken things before things merely wanting attention.

/**
 * Decides what the graphics tile says, and is careful about what it refuses to say. Cards report
 * either encoder use or whole-device use and rarely both, and the two are not the same number, so
 * whichever is available is labelled as what it is rather than passed off as the other. A figure
 * the kernel would only attribute to Valence's own work says so too, because a quiet card and a
 * busy one Valence is not using look identical from there.
 *
 * @param graphics - What the monitor read from the card, or null where there is nothing readable.
 * @returns The figure, how full the bar should be, and what the figure actually measures.

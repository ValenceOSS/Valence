 * zero is a claim, and the wrong one while a count is in progress.
 *
 * @param cache - What the monitor found on disk, or null while it is still counting.
 * @param artwork - How much artwork has been fetched and kept.
 * @param liveSessions - How many sessions are writing at the moment.
 * @param library - How much the library itself holds, where that has been worked out.
 * @param bookPages - How much the kept pages of books hold, shown only once there are some — most
 *   servers have no books, and a row of nothing on every one of them says nothing.
 * @returns The rows to show.

/**
 * Chooses what to download, and says what each choice costs before anybody commits to it.
 *
 * Every rung is shown with its size, what it looks like in words, and how it reads against the
 * original — because somebody opening this is choosing between them, not judging each on its own.
 * A number in small grey text is documentation; a comparison is what somebody acts on.
 *
 * Where the device will say how much room it has left, the sizes are read against it. "58 GB, and
 * you have 41 GB free" is the sentence that prevents the mistake; "58 GB" is the one that merely
 * records it. Anything that will not fit says so before the transfer starts rather than failing
 * part way through, and anything that would take most of what is left is called tight rather than
 * fine.
 *
 * A rung this device cannot play is offered anyway, with a word about it. Somebody may want the
 * original to keep or to watch elsewhere, and that is theirs to decide knowingly rather than to be
 * quietly decided for them.
 *
 * Where a whole programme is being asked for, the figures are what the season costs rather than
 * what one episode does. Nobody downloads one episode of a series, and "roughly 6 GB for thirteen"
 * is the number that decides it — "460 MB" is not, however accurate it is about the first one.
 *
 * @param media - What is being downloaded, or nothing while the dialog is shut.
 * @param series - The programme being downloaded whole, where it is one.
 * @param onClose - Told it was dismissed.

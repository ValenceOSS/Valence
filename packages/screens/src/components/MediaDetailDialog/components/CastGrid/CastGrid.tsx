/**
 * Shows the cast of a film or programme as a row of faces, each with the performer's name and the
 * part they played. It is the same row the libraries are browsed by, so the cast is paged and turned
 * the way everything else is rather than being a second kind of row that happens to hold people.
 *
 * Faces stand taller than they are wide, so more of them fit across than film cards do and the row
 * is asked for a denser set. A performer the catalogue has no photograph for keeps their place,
 * drawn with the same figure the person dialog uses, so a face nobody has a picture of still reads
 * as somebody rather than as a hole in the row.
 *
 * The photograph grows a little under the pointer, and the frame around it does not. Growing the
 * whole card instead pushed the picture past the rounded corners it was being clipped by, and the
 * corners came back square for as long as the pointer was on it — the same arrangement `MediaCard`
 * settled on, for the same reason.
 *
 * A performer the catalogue gave an identifier can be opened to see what else of theirs is here.
 * One the catalogue never matched is drawn the same but cannot be pressed — there is nothing behind
 * a name on its own, and offering to open it would open an empty dialog.
 *
 * @param members - The cast in billing order, each with a name, a role and an image if one is known.
 * @param onOpenPerson - Told which performer to open, where opening one is offered at all.

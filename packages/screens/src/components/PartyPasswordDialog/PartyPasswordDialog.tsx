/**
 * Asks for the password on a party somebody has been invited to.
 *
 * Shown rather than refusing outright, because an invitation with a password on it is still a good
 * invitation — the person opening it has simply not been told the word yet, and being turned away
 * with no way to answer is the one outcome that helps nobody.
 *
 * A wrong answer is said plainly and the field is left as it was, so a second attempt is one key
 * away rather than a fresh trip through the link.
 *
 * @param isOpen - Whether a party is currently asking.
 * @param wasWrong - Whether the last answer given was refused.
 * @param onJoin - Called with the password offered.
 * @param onClose - Called when they give up on it.
 * @returns The dialog.

 * Everything there is to read.

 * Choosing a book opens it rather than showing a page about it. What somebody wants from a shelf is
 * to be reading, and the chapters are in the reader's own menu — a screen in between would be a
 * screen everybody passes through on the way to the same place.
 *
 * Laid out as the other sections are: its heading is there for anybody reading the page rather than
 * looking at it, since the bar along the top already says where you are, and a banner saying it
 * again only pushed the books further down.

/**
 * Valence with no server: what is on this machine, and something to play it with.
 *
 * A deliberately smaller application rather than the ordinary one with its failures hidden. Nothing
 * here asks the server anything, because there is nothing to ask — no library, no search, no
 * account, no admin, no other profiles. Every one of those would have to be either faked from a
 * stale cache or drawn as an apology, and a screen that half-works is a worse thing to hand somebody
 * than one that was never offered.
 *
 * Going back is always offered where the server is answering again, and never taken automatically
 * from somebody who asked to be offline. Somebody who went offline on purpose an hour before a
 * flight has not changed their mind by walking past a working connection.
 *
 * Where somebody got to is remembered here and picked up from here, because there is nowhere else to
 * remember it. Watching half of something, closing the lid and opening it again is the ordinary way
 * a film gets watched on a journey, and the server that would usually keep the bookmark is the one
 * thing that is missing.
 *
 * @param title - What this instance is called.

/**
 * One block of a panel — in the admin and account dialogs alike: a tinted shell carrying what the block is and what can be done to
 * it, and a panel set into the shell carrying the block itself — the same two layers the figures at
 * the top of the overview are drawn in, so every panel is built from one kind of piece.
 *
 * The heading and its controls live in the shell rather than on the panel, so the panel holds only
 * content and a table inside it can run to its edges.
 *
 * @param title - What the block is called. Every block says, even where the tab above already
 *   does — the shell's heading is what makes the block read as one piece rather than a loose panel.
 * @param actions - Controls for the whole block, set at the right of the shell. Draw buttons here
 *   at the extra-small size: they sit in a strip of heading, not on the page.
 * @param below - A row beneath the heading, such as the block's own tabs.
 * @param children - The block itself.
 * @param isFlush - Whether the content runs to the panel's edges, for a table or a list that
 *   brings its own inner spacing.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

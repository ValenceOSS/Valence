/**
 * Teaches the media engine to fetch from the scheme the application itself was served from.
 *
 * The engine registers its fetch plugin against `http` and `https` and nothing else. An address in
 * any other scheme is not rejected as a bad address — the load simply never starts, which reaches
 * somebody watching as a film that would not play and says nothing about why.
 *
 * The server hands back a manifest address relative to the application, which is `http` in a browser
 * and the host's own scheme in the desktop client. So this is written as the page's own scheme
 * rather than as any particular one: a browser finds `http` already known and does nothing at all,
 * and a host that serves the application from a scheme of its own is understood without this having
 * to know which host that is. The plugin is the engine's own; only the name it answers to is new.
 *
 * @param net - The engine's networking, as its module exposes it.
 * @param protocol - The scheme the page was served from, colon and all.

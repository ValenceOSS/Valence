 * A browser engine works out on its own that a `video` element is playing and offers the system a

 * shows the application's name and a blank square until somebody says otherwise.
 *
 * Everything here is the Media Session API, so it is as true of a browser as of the desktop client:
 * the same lock screen on a phone, the same Now Playing panel on a Mac, the same media keys.
 *
 * The buttons are wired to the player's own handlers rather than to the element, because pausing
 * during a watch party is a message to everybody watching rather than a change to this machine — and
 * a play button on a menu bar that quietly desynchronised four people would be worse than no button.

 * Shaka is told to place each segment by the timestamps inside it rather than by where the
 * playlist says it begins. Its default moves a segment to the playlist's time, and on a copied
 * stream that drops the frames a keyframe opens with at a join — measured on a 4K HEVC remux and
 * again on a Bluray, a quarter of a second lost at each. Taking the timestamps from the order
 * segments arrive in avoided that, but kept audio and video in one buffer's timeline: with the two
 * sent apart it lets them drift, and it put the sound 60ms late after a seek even together, while
 * the segments' own timestamps held it within a frame. See VAL-307.
 *
 * Nor does it look for captions carried inside the picture, which Valence never offers — subtitles
 * go as tracks of their own. Looking means fetching the first, middle and last segments of the
 * film, and to a transcode positioned where somebody resumed, the first and the last are two seeks
 * that pull it away from them, so the film never loads.

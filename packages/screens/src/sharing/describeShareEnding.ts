/**
 * Says what a guest should see for a link that has stopped working. The three ways a link can end
 * are three different things to have happened — somebody decided, time passed, or it was opened as
 * often as it was meant to be — and a guest reading one of them is usually working out whether to
 * ask for another link or whether they have simply arrived too late.
 *
 * The sentence itself comes from the contract rather than being written again here, so that a guest
 * and anything else reading the API are told the same thing.
 *
 * A withdrawn link says somebody stopped it rather than naming them. Whoever made a link is not
 * necessarily whoever withdrew it — an administrator may withdraw anybody's — and which of them did
 * is about how the household is run, which is not a guest's business.
 *
 * @param ended - How the link ended.
 * @returns What to show: the sentence, what follows it, and the mark above it.

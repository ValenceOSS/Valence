/**
 * Gives the tests web storage back, on a Node that has taken it away.
 *
 * Node 26 declares `localStorage` on the global itself, as a stub that returns
 * undefined unless the process was started with `--localstorage-file`. Vitest
 * builds the test global by copying jsdom's window across, and skips any key
 * already present unless it is on its own allowlist — which `localStorage` is
 * not. So jsdom's perfectly good implementation is dropped in favour of Node's
 * empty one, and every test touching storage fails on a Node nobody chose.
 *
 * The repository asks for Node 22 and the image builds on it, so this only
 * bites a developer running something newer. Fixed here rather than only in
 * `.nvmrc` because the failure is baffling — `window.localStorage` is undefined
 * while `window` and `Storage` both exist — and costs an hour to work out.
 *
 * Taken from a throwaway jsdom rather than hand-written, so the tests get real
 * `Storage` semantics: quota, `key()`, `length`, and the same coercion of
 * non-string values a browser does.

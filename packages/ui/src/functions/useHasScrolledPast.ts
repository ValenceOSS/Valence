/**
 * Whether something has been scrolled up out of sight, for anything that should appear only once it
 * has — a condensed bar standing in for a heading that has gone.
 *
 * Measured against the thing scrolling rather than against the window. Inside a dialog those are
 * not the same: content scrolls away under the dialog's own edge while staying comfortably within
 * the window, so a check against the window says nothing has moved and the bar never arrives.
 *
 * Where the page itself is what scrolls, both the asking and the measuring are done of the window
 * rather than of the root element. A page scrolled by the document announces it at the document, not
 * at the `<html>` element standing in for it, so a listener left on that element is never spoken to.
 * And the root element is no use to measure against either: its box climbs as the page is scrolled,
 * at the same rate as everything in it, so a mark within it is forever the same distance below its
 * top and never passes it however far down the page somebody goes. The top of the window stays where
 * it is, which is the whole point of it.
 *
 * Hands back something to attach rather than taking a ref, because a dialog's contents are not
 * there until it opens. A ref object is the same object before and after that, so an effect
 * watching one runs once against nothing and never runs again; this is told the moment the element
 * appears, and told again when it goes.
 *
 * @returns What to attach to a sentinel at the foot of the heading, and whether it has gone.

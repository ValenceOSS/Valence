/**
 * How far one press moves the row, and how much of the next card is left showing.
 *
 * As many whole cards as fit, rather than a fraction of the track. A row that scrolls by a share of
 * its own width leaves a card cut down the middle wherever it stops, and the next press cuts a
 * different one; stepping by whole cards means every card the row settles on is a whole card, and
 * what hangs over the edge is always the next one rather than the middle of one.
 *
 * What hangs over is the point. The row is wider than the cards that fit it, and the remainder shows
 * the front of the next card — which is what says the row goes on without needing to be told.
 *
 * Past the first page it hangs over at both ends, because by then there is as much behind as ahead.
 * That is the row's own doing rather than this one's: a row that holds a lane open down its left side
 * has somewhere for the card behind to sit, and a page turn lands against that lane instead of
 * against the edge. A row that holds no lane open pages flush, as it always did.
 *
 * Measured from the first card rather than from a number, because a card is a share of the window on
 * a phone and a fixed width on a desktop, and only the element knows which it is at the moment.
 * Falls back to a fraction of the track where there is nothing to measure — an empty row, or one
 * whose children have not been laid out.
 *
 * What shows of the hanging card is what the eye can see of it, which is less than the room left over
 * once whole cards are counted: the row starts a little in from its own edge, and there is a gap in
 * front of the hanging card. Both sit in the remainder without being part of the card, and a measure
 * that forgot them would draw the arrow wider than the card it stands on.
 *
 * @param track - The scrolling element.
 * @returns How far one page is, how much of the hanging card shows, how many cards fit, and the gap
 *   and inset that separate them.

/**
 * Turns a horizontally scrolling row into one that can be paged through, measuring how many pages
 * its contents come to and which is showing. Measured from the element rather than calculated from
 * the item count, since what fits depends on the window rather than on the data.
 *
 * @param watching - What the contents come to, so the measurement is taken again when they change.
 *   A count rather than the contents themselves: a row's cards are all one width, so how many there
 *   are is the whole of what the measurement depends on.
 * @returns A ref for the track, the pages found, whether the row is at either end of itself, how
 *   much of the next card shows, and ways to measure and move it. The ends are read from where the
 *   row actually is rather than from the page number, since a row rarely ends on a whole page and a
 *   rounded page number there says the wrong thing about which way is left to go.

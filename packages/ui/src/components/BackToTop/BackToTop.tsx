/**
 * The way back to the top of a page long enough to have lost it, which a page that goes on for as
 * long as there is something to show will always be.
 *
 * Stays out of the way until the top has actually gone. A control offering to return somewhere you
 * can already see is noise, so it is judged against a marker left at the top rather than against a
 * guessed number of pixels — the marker is where the top is, whatever the page turns out to be.
 *
 * Which is why it is mounted first and draws a marker of its own: the button floats free of the
 * page, but the marker has to sit where the page begins. It rises into place and sinks back out
 * rather than blinking on, since something appearing in the corner of the eye is read as a fault
 * where something arriving is read as an offer. Whoever asked for stillness is given the fade alone,
 * and for them the journey back is instant too — a page this long scrolled smoothly is a long way to
 * watch travel past.
 *
 * The button is drawn outside the page rather than within it. Anything held inside something that
 * has been moved is fixed against that thing rather than against the window, and a screen animating
 * in has been moved, however slightly — so a button left there rides up the page as it scrolls
 * instead of staying where it was put. Only the button leaves; the marker stays where the top is.
 *
 * @param label - What it does in words, for anything reading the page aloud.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

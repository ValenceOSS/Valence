/**
 * Holds the screen with the platform's own mark while the application works out what it is showing
 * — whether setup is done, who is signed in, and what was being watched. Its own mark rather than a
 * spinner, since this is the first thing anybody sees.
 *
 * The mark stands alone, with no name under it — a mark that needs its own name written beneath is
 * not doing its job. That only holds while the platform is called Valence: an operator who has renamed
 * it gets the name set instead, since the mark is not theirs to stand for.
 *
 * The ground it holds is opaque until the mark has finished travelling, and only then fades. A
 * screen that vanishes the moment the mark sets off shows the page arriving underneath a logo still
 * in flight, which reads as two things happening rather than one handing over to the other.
 *
 * @param name - What the platform is called, which may have been renamed by an operator.
 * @param label - What is being waited for, read out to anybody who cannot see the screen.
 * @param isReady - Whether what was being waited for has arrived, which takes the bar away.
 * @param marksPlace - The name the mark travels under, where it goes on to somewhere else.
 * @param hasMark - Whether this screen is the one holding the mark. False once the mark has been
 *   handed on, so that two of them are never on screen under the same name.
 * @param isLeaving - Whether the ground is fading, which it does once the mark has landed.

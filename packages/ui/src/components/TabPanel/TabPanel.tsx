/**
 * What one tab shows. Renders only when its tab is the one chosen, so a panel that fetches
 * something does not fetch it until somebody looks.
 *
 * Where a caller supplies an element to render as, the panel's own content goes inside it rather
 * than replacing it — the element is the wrapper, not the contents.
 *
 * Given a direction, the panel arrives from the side it was reached from, the way a submenu does:
 * forwards and it comes in from the right, back and it comes in from the left. Only what arrives
 * moves — what left has already gone, and animating it out would hold up the thing being waited for.
 *
 * @param value - Which tab this panel belongs to.
 * @param children - What the panel holds.
 * @param render - An element to render as, where a plain division is not the right thing.
 * @param travel - Which way the tabs were moved through, from `useTravelDirection`.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

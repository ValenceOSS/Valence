/**
 * Shows how far through a piece of long-running work something is. A null value means the work has
 * started but has not said how much there is to do, which is drawn as movement without a position
 * rather than as an empty bar — an empty bar reads as nothing having happened.
 *
 * @param label - What the work is, read out to anybody who cannot see the bar.
 * @param value - How much is done, or null where the total is not yet known.
 * @param max - The total to measure against, defaulting to a hundred.
 * @param children - Anything to draw beneath the bar, such as what is being worked on now.
 * @param readout - The figure to show beside the bar, where a caller wants one of its own.
 * @param isFull - Whether the bar takes the whole width it is given, rather than its own short length.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

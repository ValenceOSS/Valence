/**
 * Shows a rating out of five as a row of stars, and takes one where it is given a way to report it.
 * Read-only it fills fractionally, so a household average of 4.2 is drawn as four stars and a fifth
 * mostly filled rather than rounded to something nobody gave it. That is done by drawing all five
 * filled stars at full size and clipping them, which is why the filled row is sized to its content
 * and its glyphs refuse to shrink: left to flex them, they fit themselves to the clip instead of
 * being cut by it, and a three out of five came out as five squashed stars. Interactive it fills in
 * whole steps
 * only, previews under a pointer, and treats pressing the star already given as taking the rating
 * back — which is the one gesture a row of stars otherwise has no room for.
 *
 * @param stars - What has been given, or null where nothing has.
 * @param label - What is being rated, for anybody not looking at the screen.
 * @param onRate - Called with the rating pressed; its absence is what makes the row read-only.
 * @param onClear - Called when the star already given is pressed again.
 * @param size - How large to draw the stars.
 * @param isDisabled - Whether the row is inert, as it is while a rating is being written.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

/**
 * The things a dialog is for: the one worth pressing, and the rest beside it.
 *
 * On anything wide they are laid out as equal columns, which is what a row of actions should look
 * like when there is room for it. On a phone there is not: three of them either run off the side or
 * wrap into a grid with a hole in it, and a fourth makes every label unreadable. So the main action
 * keeps the bar and the rest fold into a menu — the same actions, in the same order, reached by one
 * more press.
 *
 * The two arrangements are both drawn and one is hidden, rather than measured and chosen. What to
 * show is a question about width, which CSS already knows the answer to; asking JavaScript means
 * asking again on every resize and being wrong until the first one.
 *
 * @param label - What the folded menu is, read out to anybody who cannot see it.
 * @param primary - The action worth pressing, which keeps the bar at every width.
 * @param actions - Everything else, shown beside it or folded into the menu.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

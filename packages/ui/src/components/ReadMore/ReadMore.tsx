/**
 * A passage of text cut to a few lines, with a way to see the rest.
 *
 * The control appears only where there is actually more to see, which is measured rather than
 * guessed at from the length of the string: a paragraph's height depends on the width it is given
 * and the size the reader has chosen, so counting characters offers to expand text that is already
 * whole. It is measured again when the width changes, since a passage that fitted in a wide dialog
 * may not fit in a narrow one.
 *
 * @param children - The text.
 * @param lines - How many lines to show before cutting.
 * @param moreLabel - What the control says when there is more to see.
 * @param lessLabel - What it says when everything is showing.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.
 * @returns The passage, and the control where one is warranted.

/**
 * Says why a screen is empty, in the one shape every empty screen uses.
 *
 * There were four of these and they agreed on nothing — the films and programmes pages drew a bare
 * paragraph against the left margin, the books page centred a larger heading with no icon, and the
 * home page did a third thing. A household that has just installed Valence sees several of these
 * before it sees anything else, and four answers to the same question read as four different
 * products.
 *
 * Whether it fills the page is the caller's to say, because the same words are a whole screen when
 * nothing has been set up and a note under a heading when one shelf of several is empty.
 *
 * @param of - The icon to draw above it.
 * @param title - What is missing, said in a few words.
 * @param detail - Why, and what would change it, where the title does not already say it.
 * @param action - What to press about it, where there is anything to press.
 * @param fills - Whether this is the whole screen rather than a note within one.

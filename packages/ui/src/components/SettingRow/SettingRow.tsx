/**
 * One setting, said in two lines and answered on the right: what it is, what it does to you if you
 * change it, and the control that changes it. The pattern the whole of Valence's settings are made
 * of, kept in one place so that a switch, a menu and a button all sit on the same baseline and
 * leave the same room around them rather than each screen arranging its own.
 *
 * The row is not itself pressable. What answers the setting is the control on the right, which
 * keeps one press target per row instead of two that disagree about what they do.
 *
 * @param title - What the setting is.
 * @param description - What changing it does, in one line.
 * @param icon - Something to draw before the title.
 * @param children - The control that answers it.
 * @param isMarked - Whether this is the row being pointed at, which outlines it.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

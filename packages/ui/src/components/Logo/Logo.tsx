/**
 * The Valence mark, painted rather than drawn.
 *
 * The file is a mask rather than an image, which is what lets the mark take a colour at all: an
 * `<img>` is whatever colour it was exported as, while a mask is a hole through which anything can
 * be seen. What shows through here is a conic gradient from the ink colour through the brand colour and
 * back, so the mark is lit rather than filled — and dark on a light theme, light on a dark one.
 *
 * The light moves where the mark is worth looking at and holds still where it is not. A logo in the
 * corner of every screen that shimmers all day is a distraction with a licence; the same logo holding
 * the screen on the way in is the one moment it has anybody's attention. So `isAnimated` is asked for
 * rather than assumed, and it stops entirely for anybody who has asked for less motion.
 *
 * How it moves depends on what it is made of. Solid, the gradient turns behind it. Dotted, a wave
 * travels out from the middle and the dots light as it passes — the same ripple the empty screens
 * run through their own dots, so the mark and the ground behind it move by one idea rather than two.
 *
 * @param hasEdge - Whether the mark carries a keyline. Not a box: a copy of the mark sits behind it
 *   in the brand colour, spread a pixel outward by a chain of shadows that follow its alpha, and the
 *   mark itself is laid over the top so only that fringe shows. The mark is given a solid body when
 *   it is edged, since a dotted one would otherwise let the colour behind it through the gaps.
 * @param isDotted - Whether the mark is drawn as a field of dots rather than as solid ink. The dots
 *   rest dim and light as the wave reaches them, which is what a dot-matrix does and what the empty
 *   screens already do behind their own dots. The grid is set in pixels rather than in fractions of
 *   the mark, so the dots are the same size wherever the mark is used. Worth asking for where the
 *   mark is large; at the size it sits in a dock the dots turn to mush.
 * @param isSolid - Whether the mark is one flat ink, the colour of the words around it, rather
 *   than lit by the brand gradient — for a bar where everything beside it is drawn flat, and a
 *   coloured mark would read as the one thing on it asking to be looked at.
 * @param isCurrentColour - Whether the mark is one flat ink in the colour of the text it is set
 *   in, rather than the theme's own text colour — for a mark set among words on a coloured band.
 * @param size - How tall the mark is, in pixels at the base text size — drawn in rem, so it grows
 *   with the text on a large screen; its width follows from its own proportions, since
 *   this mark is wider than it is tall and a square box would sit it in a letterbox with dead space
 *   above and below. Omit it to size the mark from the class instead, in which case the proportion
 *   is held by `aspect-ratio` so a height alone is still enough — which is what a mark set beside
 *   type wants, growing and shrinking with it rather than being set twice.
 * @param isAnimated - Whether the light turns, which is for screens somebody waits on.
 * @param label - What it is, for anybody who cannot see it; omit where a name sits beside it.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.
 * @param src - Where the mark is served from, which the application owns.

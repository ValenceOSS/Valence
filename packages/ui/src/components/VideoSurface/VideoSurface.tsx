/**
 * The one place a `<video>` element is written. Owns the element and its events and nothing else —
 * no controls, no chrome, no session handling — so the player above it can be rebuilt without the
 * picture ever being torn down and remounted.
 *
 * @param src - What to play, where it is a file that can simply be named. A stream is attached to
 *   the element by the player driving it instead, because a playlist is assembled rather than
 *   pointed at — but a file already on the disk needs none of that and is only an address.
 * @param label - What is playing, read out to anybody who cannot see it.
 * @param videoRef - A handle on the element, for the player that drives it.
 * @param poster - A frame to show before playback starts.
 * @param textTrack - The subtitle track to attach, where one is selected.
 * @param isDrawnElsewhere - Whether somebody above is drawing the subtitles. The track is still
 *   attached and still loaded, because a picture-in-picture window has no text tracks of its own and
 *   reads its lines from these — it is only the drawing that is somebody else's.
 * @param onTimeUpdate - Told the position as it moves.
 * @param onDurationChange - Told the length once the file says what it is.
 * @param onPlayingChange - Told when playback starts or stops.
 * @param onBufferingChange - Told when the picture is waiting for data and when it has some again.
 *   A download going quiet is not waiting: the picture plays on from what it holds, so only the
 *   picture stopping counts, and it counts as over the moment the picture moves again.
 * @param onEnded - Told when the file reaches its end.
 * @param loops - Whether to start again at the end, for a preview rather than a film.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

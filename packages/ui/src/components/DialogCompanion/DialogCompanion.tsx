/**
 * A panel that stands beside the dialog it was opened from rather than over it. Written where the
 * thing it explains lives — a row deep inside a panel — and drawn at the edge of the dialog that row
 * sits in, because a second dialog laid over the first hides the very thing it was opened to explain.
 *
 * It is carried to the column rather than copied into it. A copy is taken once, so a form that
 * changed — a role granted, a name typed — went on showing what it held at the moment it opened.
 * Sent through a portal, what is drawn beside the dialog is the same thing the panel is rendering,
 * so it answers to its own state as it always did and simply appears somewhere else.
 *
 * Opened from somewhere with no dialog above it, it is an ordinary dialog. A panel is only a
 * companion to something — there is nothing for it to stand beside on a bare page — and a control
 * that works inside the admin dialog must still work on a screen that is not one.
 *
 * On a screen too narrow to stand two panels side by side it is an ordinary dialog as well, laid
 * over the one it came from. Standing beside is the whole idea of a companion, and where there is no
 * beside to stand in, a column sharing a row with a panel that wants all of it has nowhere to go.
 * Better to cover the thing for a moment than to be squeezed out of sight next to it.
 *
 * What stands in the column is offered no column of its own, which is why the children are handed a
 * slot of `null`. There is one column and the newest claim wins it, so a companion rendered inside
 * another's children took the column from the panel it lives in — that panel then drew nothing, which
 * unmounted the very thing that had just claimed it, which released the claim and put the first panel
 * back with its state reset. Pressing Add trigger inside a job's schedule did exactly that and looked
 * like a button doing nothing. Seeing no slot, a companion down there is an ordinary dialog laid over
 * the top, which is what it already is on a narrow screen.
 *
 * @param label - What the panel is, read out when it stands alone.
 * @param isOpen - Whether it is showing.
 * @param onClose - Told when it was dismissed.
 * @param children - The panel's content, usually a title and some content.
 * @param size - How large it stands when it stands alone, as a dialog of its own; beside another,
 *   it takes the column it is given.

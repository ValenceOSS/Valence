/**
 * Draws a pane of glass — translucent, blurred, with a hairline edge — which is the surface the
 * platform floats things on: the dock, the player's controls, popovers. What passes beneath stays
 * visible, so the page belongs to what is being shown and the interface rests on top of it.
 *
 * @param children - What the pane holds.
 * @param elevation - How far off the page it reads, which sets the blur and the edge. `film` is the
 *   dark, see-through glass the video player's controls are made of, for a bar that floats over
 *   whatever the page is showing and should let it through.
 * @param as - The element to render as, where a plain division is not the right thing.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

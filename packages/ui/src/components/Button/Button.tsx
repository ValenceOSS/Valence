/**
 * The one place a `<button>` is written. Everything pressable in Valence is this or composes it, which
 * is what keeps focus rings, disabled states, loading behaviour and tooltips the same everywhere
 * rather than reinvented per screen. A raw button elsewhere is lint-banned, and there is
 * deliberately no separate icon button — an icon button is this with an icon and a label.
 *
 * How it is painted is declared as variants rather than assembled per caller, so that the
 * combinations — a small icon-only ghost, a large primary — resolve by one set of rules instead of
 * drifting apart. The corner is the loudest thing about a button after its colour, so the default is
 * the same modest radius everything else in Valence wears, whatever is inside it. A circle is asked for
 * rather than inferred: carrying only an icon is not a reason to be round, or every close button in
 * the product becomes a bubble.
 *
 * @param children - What the button shows; optional, since a control can be its own content.
 * @param variant - How it is painted, from the headline glossy down to bare, which paints nothing.
 * @param size - How large it is, or none to leave height and padding to the caller.
 * @param isLoading - Whether the thing it does is under way, which also stops it being pressed twice.
 * @param isPill - Whether to round it fully, which is a circle for an icon on its own.
 * @param label - What it does in words, required of anything wearing only an icon.
 * @param isIconOnly - Whether it is a glyph and nothing else, which makes it square rather than wide.
 * @param isActive - Whether what it does is currently in force, said as well as shown.
 * @param hasTooltip - Whether resting a pointer on it shows the label.
 * @param tooltipDelayMilliseconds - How long a pointer rests before the label appears.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

/**
 * The platform's one navigation bar, along the top of the window: the mark, the places, and the
 * tools at the right, which do something rather than going somewhere.
 *
 * Clear while the page is at its top, so the first thing somebody sees is the page rather than
 * chrome laid over it, and painted in as they scroll, so whatever passes beneath does not run
 * through the words. How far painted in it is belongs to the page, since only the page knows how
 * far it has been scrolled and where its content begins.
 *
 * It follows the scroll rather than switching at a point in it. A switch is all or nothing however
 * softly it eases, and on a page with a hero there is a long stretch of scroll before anything
 * reaches the bar — room for it to arrive gradually, and a snap to solid a few pixels in wastes it.
 *
 * The paint is a layer of its own, so that one opacity carries the colour, the blur and the edge
 * together: a blur behind glass cannot be eased on its own, and would jump while the colour faded.
 *
 * A single mark rests on where you are, follows the pointer to whatever it passes over, and returns
 * when the pointer leaves. Places are words wherever there is room for them and their icons where
 * there is not — and the place being stood on carries its icon beside its word as well, so where you
 * are is said twice rather than only by the mark behind it. That icon holds still under the pointer:
 * it sits beside a word rather than standing in for one, and a lift or a wipe there reads as the
 * word jumping; the tools are always icons, named on hover.
 *
 * On a narrow screen the places fold into a menu behind one mark, because the row of them there is
 * icons with their words suppressed — a line of glyphs to be guessed at rather than read. A menu
 * gives each one its word back and says which is being stood on. The tools stay out on the bar
 * beside it: searching and the rest are done from wherever you are, and burying them a tap deeper
 * to tidy the bar would cost more than the tidying is worth.
 *
 * An action whose control has a panel open is held still while it is open, because a popover is
 * anchored to the icon that opened it and a gesture played underneath it would shove the panel.
 *
 * A place that was just pressed is lit from the press itself rather than from the address, because
 * the address arrives a commit later: reading the mark from it alone sent the mark back to the place
 * you had left and then forward again, which is the one movement a travelling mark must never make.
 *
 * Focus moving from one place to the next is not focus leaving the bar. A blur is raised by the
 * control being left and rises through the bar, so treating any of them as the pointer leaving
 * dropped the highlight in the middle of a press — the same flick back, by a second route.
 *
 * Something the pointer is on is lit, and so is something keyboard focus has reached — but not
 * something focus was merely handed back to. Closing a dialog returns focus to the control that
 * opened it, and lighting on any focus left that control marked as the place you were long after
 * the dialog had gone.
 *
 * @param brand - The mark at the left of the bar.
 * @param items - The places, in the order they are shown.
 * @param selectedId - Which place is being stood on.
 * @param onSelect - Told which place was chosen.
 * @param actions - The tools at the right.
 * @param solidity - How far painted in it is, from clear at nothing to solid at one. Solid where
 *   the page does not say, since a bar that cannot be read over content is worse than one that is
 *   never clear.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

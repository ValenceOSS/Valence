/**
 * Holds whether a tooltip is already showing, for every tooltip on the page.
 *
 * Wrapped once near the root and nowhere else. The pause before a name appears exists so that
 * crossing a row of icons does not flash one on each; once any name is showing that pause has done
 * its job, and the next name should be instant. That skip is shared state, so it needs one owner —
 * a scope per tooltip means every tooltip is the first tooltip and none of them ever skips, which is
 * the difference between a toolbar that feels quick and one that feels reluctant.
 *
 * @param children - The application.
 * @returns The application, with its tooltips able to agree about the pause.

/**
 * The one place a dialog is written. Holds the panel, the overlay, the focus trap and the escape
 * handling, so a caller supplies only what is inside. Every dialog in Valence is this or composes it; a
 * raw dialog element elsewhere is lint-banned.
 *
 * The overlay sits at the same height as the panel rather than below it, so that what decides the
 * order of two open dialogs is which was opened last rather than which rule happens to be higher. An
 * overlay lower than the panel dimmed the page a second time and left the dialog it opened over
 * untouched — the one thing it was meant to put behind.
 *
 * It enters from the bottom on a phone and from its own centre on anything larger, because a sheet
 * is what a small screen expects and a panel is what a large one does. Both leave the way they
 * arrived, so dismissing reads as the reverse of opening rather than as a second, unrelated event.
 *
 * Leaving is eased differently to arriving, which is the difference between an animation that runs
 * and one that can be seen. `--ease-out` is deliberately front-loaded so that a thing arriving feels
 * immediate; measured on the way out it put the panel at half opacity three milliseconds in and at a
 * tenth of it after thirty, spending the rest of its time invisible. That reads as vanishing however
 * long the duration says it lasts. On `--ease-in-out` the panel holds its shape for the first third
 * and is half gone at fifty milliseconds, which is the same length of animation and a visible one.
 *
 * A dialog opened from inside a dialog stands beside it rather than over it, where anything within
 * asks for that. The panel and its companion are one row held at a fixed width, so the panel narrows
 * by exactly what the companion takes and neither is positioned by hand.
 *
 * What stands beside it is carried here rather than copied: this holds the column, and whatever
 * asked for it draws into that column from where it already lives. A copy would be taken once, and a
 * form that changed afterwards — a role granted, a name typed — would go on showing what it held
 * when it opened.
 *
 * Side by side needs a side: below the small breakpoint the two are stacked in the one sheet, since
 * a phone has no room to put anything next to anything. The width has to be asked for in script
 * rather than written as a class, because it is animated and an animated width is an inline style
 * that no breakpoint reaches — left as a fixed `min(26rem, 40vw)`, the stacked column is 156px of
 * sliver on a phone, which is the arrangement reading as broken rather than as narrow.
 *
 * Opening puts focus on the panel rather than on the first control inside it. Landing on a control
 * draws a focus ring around whatever happens to be first — the favourite button, an icon — which
 * reads as though the dialog has already chosen something on the viewer's behalf. The panel takes
 * the focus instead, so the keyboard still works and nothing appears pre-selected.
 *
 * It follows the browser into fullscreen. A portal defaults to the body, which the browser paints
 * underneath the fullscreen element, so a dialog raised over the player would otherwise open where
 * nobody could see it.
 *
 * @param label - What the dialog is, read out on opening.
 * @param isOpen - Whether it is showing.
 * @param onClose - Told when it was dismissed, by the overlay, the escape key or a close button.
 * @param children - What the dialog holds, usually a title, some content and a footer.
 * @param size - How large it stands. A stage fills the screen on a phone and takes the same broad
 *   panel on anything larger. Its height is fixed rather than bounded, because a floor and a ceiling
 *   only agree when the content reaches one of them. A drawer fills the screen on a phone too, but
 *   stands at the foot of it rather than the centre on anything larger, and slides up rather than
 *   fading in — see `Drawer`, the component that composes this size.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

/**
 * Says that something could not be read, and offers to try again.
 *
 * It is the third state a panel needs and the one that was missing. A panel reading from the server
 * has three answers, not two: it is still reading, there is nothing there, or it could not find out.
 * Where the third was drawn as the second — an empty shelf for a refused session or a server that is
 * down — somebody was told there is nothing rather than that nobody knows, which is a different fact
 * and points at a different fix.
 *
 * Trying again is offered rather than merely described because most of what puts a panel here passes:
 * a request that timed out, a server part way through starting, a network that dropped. Where it does
 * not pass, pressing it costs nothing.
 *
 * @param what - What could not be read, named as the reader would name it, such as `your library`.
 * @param onTryAgain - Asked to read it again.
 * @param isTryingAgain - Whether that is happening now, which the button shows rather than the panel.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

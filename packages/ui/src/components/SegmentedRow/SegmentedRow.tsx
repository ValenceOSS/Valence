/**
 * A set of choices drawn as one track rather than as separate pills: a single rounded rail with the
 * chosen one lit inside it. The difference matters — a row of individually bordered pills reads as
 * several buttons that happen to be adjacent, where one track reads as a single control with a
 * setting, which is what choosing between libraries actually is.
 *
 * For choices that change what is shown without changing where you are. Where the choices are
 * panels under a bar, `TabRow` is the same track wired to those panels instead.
 *
 * @param label - What the choice is about, read out to anybody who cannot see it.
 * @param size - How large the track stands.
 * @param tone - How the chosen one is lit: inverted where the row is where you are, and tinted
 *   where it is a setting inside a dialog rather than a place to go.
 * @param items - The choices, in the order they should be offered; one marked absent is drawn
 *   fainter, for a choice that can be made but which this server has nothing behind.
 * @param value - Which one is chosen, so the mark can travel to it.
 * @param onSelect - Told which one was pressed.
 * @param fills - Whether the choices share the whole width of the track evenly, for a row that is
 *   stretched across its space rather than sized to its words.
 * @param className - Extra classes for the caller's own layout.

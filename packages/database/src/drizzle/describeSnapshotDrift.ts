/**
 * Says what generating a migration produced on a tree that should have had nothing left to produce.
 *
 * A snapshot is what `drizzle-kit generate` diffs the schema against, so a missing one does not
 * announce itself: generation succeeds, and the migration it writes recreates everything added since
 * the last snapshot it can see. That SQL reads plausibly. Applying it against a populated database
 * fails on the first `CREATE TABLE`, or half-applies if the statements are run one at a time.
 *
 * Migrations written by hand are what leaves the gap, because nothing then asks drizzle-kit for a
 * snapshot at all. This is the check that a hand-written migration was accompanied by one.
 *
 * @param produced - Paths generating created, relative to the migrations directory.
 * @returns What to say and fail with, or nothing where the tree was already in step.

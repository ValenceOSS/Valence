/**
 * Whether the application should be its small self, and why.
 *
 * Offline is a mode rather than a run of failed requests. A client that has lost its server cannot
 * honestly draw a library, a search or an account page — none of those exist on this machine — and a
 * screen that half-works is a worse thing to be handed than one that is not offered. So the shape of
 * the application changes: what is on this disk, and the player.
 *
 * Two ways in and they mean the same thing. The server stopping answering is noticed by the host,
 * which is the only thing that sees every request; asking for it deliberately is the case that
 * matters more, because somebody about to fly wants to know now whether what they meant to take is
 * really here.
 *
 * Only where files can be kept. A browser with no network has nothing to fall back to, so putting it
 * into a mode built around a shelf of downloads would be showing it an empty room and calling it a
 * feature. It draws its ordinary errors instead, which is the honest thing to draw.
 *
 * Reach is read again after subscribing, not only before. Between the first read and the listener
 * being attached there is a gap, and a host that publishes only on a change publishes into it once
 * and never again — which left a window offline against a server that had been answering for hours.
 *
 * @returns What mode this is, and how to change it.

 * keeping; the route they took to get there is not, and keeping it would grow without bound on a
 * long flight.
 *

 * second, and writing each one would mean rewriting a file on the disk hundreds of times per film
 * for a figure nobody will read until the aeroplane lands.
 *
 * @param mediaId - What was being watched.
 * @param positionSeconds - Where they got to.
 * @param durationSeconds - How long it runs.
 * @param atMs - When, which decides whose answer wins when the server has one too.

/**
 * Reads the part of an address that sits over whatever section it was opened from — what is being
 * searched for, which dialog is open, which panel of the admin page is showing.
 *
 * Anything that will not read is dropped rather than thrown, because an address is something people
 * edit, truncate and paste: `?person=banana` should open no dialog, not fail to load the page. This
 * is where the router validates a search, so it is also the only place that decides what one means.
 *
 * What was not said is left out rather than answered with nothing, because the router writes this
 * back to the address bar: an answer of `null` becomes `?party=null` in somebody's address.
 *
 * @param raw - What the address carried.
 * @returns What it means, with nothing where it said nothing.

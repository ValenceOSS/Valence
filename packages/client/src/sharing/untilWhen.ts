/**
 * Says what still holds a link open, for one that is still working — or used up, which stops only
 * new people opening it, not those who already have. A link with neither an end date
 * nor a limit works until somebody withdraws it, which is worth saying plainly rather than leaving
 * blank. Worded without an owner, since the same phrase is read by whoever made the link and by
 * whoever looks after everybody's.
 *
 * @param share - The link.
 * @returns The phrase to show.

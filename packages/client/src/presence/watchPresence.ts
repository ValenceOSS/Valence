 * Puts this tab in the administrator's list of open sessions, and carries an instruction to stop or

 *
 * The socket is the presence connection rather than something kept alongside one, so a tab that has
 * gone is noticed by the same thing that noticed it arrive, and there is no second stream that can
 * drift out of step with it.
 *
 * What kind of client this is goes with it, because a list of sessions read by shape is read faster
 * than one read by name, and guessing at the shape from the name gets a phone somebody called
 * after themselves wrong.
 *
 * @param client - The connection to watch over, which is the shared one unless a test says otherwise.
 * @returns The function that stops watching.

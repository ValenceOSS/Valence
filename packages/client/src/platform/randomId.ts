/**
 * Makes a random identifier without requiring a secure context.
 *
 * `crypto.randomUUID` is only defined where the page is a secure context, which
 * a self-hosted Valence reached at `http://192.168.1.10` is not — browsers grant
 * that status to `localhost` and to HTTPS, and to nothing else. Calling it on a
 * plain LAN address throws, and the throw unmounted the whole application: the
 * splash screen appeared, presence started, and the tab went blank.
 *
 * `crypto.getRandomValues` carries no such restriction, so the same version 4
 * layout is assembled from it directly: the version nibble in byte 6, the
 * variant bits in byte 8.
 *
 * Whether there is one at all is asked of `globalThis` before anything is
 * named, because a host without Web Crypto makes naming it a reference error —
 * the guard meant to survive a missing method was itself the thing that threw.
 *
 * @returns A version 4 UUID.

/**
 * Moves what this device already remembers to the names it is remembered under now.
 *
 * These keys are the one part of a rename that is not ours to change freely: they are written into
 * somebody's machine, and the value is only reachable through the name it was written under. Renamed
 * without this, every one of them reads as absent — which does not fail, it silently resets. Somebody
 * opens a version that is meant only to look different and finds their captions restyled, their grid
 * back to the default, their server forgotten, and their device introducing itself to the sessions
 * list as a stranger.
 *
 * A key already carried over is left alone, so this can run on every start and only does anything on
 * the first. The old name is forgotten once the new one holds the value, which is what stops it
 * running for ever and what makes a later downgrade honest about what it has lost.
 *
 * @param store - Where this device keeps what it remembers.
 * @returns Which keys were carried over, for anybody who wants to say so.

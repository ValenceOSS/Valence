 * answers mean, what is worth caching. What differs is where a preference is kept and what this
 * machine is called — a browser has `localStorage` and a user agent, a desktop application has a
 * file and an operating system that will say its own name. So the host supplies those on the way up
 * and nothing below has to know which host it was.
 *
 * It is installed once rather than passed down, because the code that needs it is plain functions
 * rather than components — a reader called from a query has no context to reach into. A test
 * installs whatever it wants to pretend to be.
 *
 * Installing is also the moment anything this device already remembers is carried to the names it is
 * remembered under now. It happens here because here is the first point at which there is a store to
 * read, and it is before anything has asked it a question — a preference read before its value had
 * been carried across would read as absent, and absent means the default.
 *

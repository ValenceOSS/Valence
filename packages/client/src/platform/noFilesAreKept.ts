/**
 * What a client that cannot keep a file answers when asked what it is holding.
 *
 * A browser is the case this exists for. Its storage is a quota rather than a disk, eviction needs
 * no warning, and a transfer cannot outlive the tab — so nothing is ever held, and the honest
 * answer to every question is that there is nothing here.
 *
 * Refusing outright rather than answering emptily would be worse: the screens that ask are the same
 * screens either way, and one that has to know which client it is running on to avoid asking is a
 * screen that knows too much.
 *
 * @returns Somewhere nothing is kept.

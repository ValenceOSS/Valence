/**
 * Reads something from Valence, and throws where it could not be read.
 *
 * Every failure leaves by the same door: a refusal throws `RequestFailed` carrying the status, a
 * server that cannot be reached throws whatever `fetch` threw, and a body that does not match its
 * schema throws the parse error. None of them are turned into a value, which is the whole point —
 * a query that rejects is retried by the cache, and a screen can tell being unable to read something
 * from there being nothing to read.
 *
 * An empty answer now means the server said there is nothing.
 *
 * The path is put on whichever server this client watches, which is the page's own origin in a
 * browser and an address a viewer configured in a client with a window of its own.
 *
 * @param path - What to ask for.
 * @param schema - The shape the answer must be in.
 * @param headers - Anything the request has to carry beyond asking for json, such as which face is
 *   watching, where what comes back depends on it.
 * @returns The answer, parsed.

/**
 * Builds the one client that speaks to better-auth, which this module holds and nothing else sees.
 *
 * Every request to `/api/auth` goes through it rather than being written out as a `fetch` with a
 * hand-written schema beside it. The library types its own protocol, so an endpoint or a payload
 * that changes underneath us stops the build rather than a passkey ceremony in production.
 *
 * The vanilla client rather than the React one, because the answers belong in the shared cache with
 * everything else the server has said, not in a second store of the library's own. It is not
 * exported either, and the reason is worth knowing: the type of a client carrying three plugins is
 * longer than TypeScript will serialise across a module boundary, so what leaves this module is a
 * set of named functions with types of their own. That is the better shape anyway — a component
 * should ask for what it wants rather than reach for a client.
 *
 * The plugins are the ones the server mounts and this application calls: `admin` for the role on a
 * user, `twoFactor`, `passkey`, and `deviceAuthorization` for signing a television in from a phone.
 *
 * Its `fetch` is handed over rather than left to be found, for two reasons and no others: the
 * library reads the global once when the client is built, which is before a test has had a chance
 * to stand in for it, and it asks with a `URL` where a caller may be expecting a string.
 *
 * Nothing else is done to the request. A shim here once added a content type as well, on the theory
 * that the library sent a body without naming it — it sends `{}` with `application/json` and
 * `credentials: include` of its own accord, so that was an answer to a question nobody had asked,
 * sitting on the one path where a mistake ends a session or fails to.
 *
 * @returns The client.

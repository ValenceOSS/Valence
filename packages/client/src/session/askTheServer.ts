 * in mind: it runs in a browser, in a window that serves its own pages, and in a test with neither.
 *
 * A browser has one already: the page's own origin, which is the server that served it, and which
 * the library is perfectly happy with. It is handed that.
 *
 * A client that serves its own pages has an origin of its own making — `valence://app` — which the
 * library refuses outright, so that one is handed a base it accepts and never asked to fetch. What
 * it builds on top is turned back into a path on the way out.
 *
 * The placeholder is only ever used where it is needed. Handing it to a browser as well would be
 * substituting a host that does not resolve for one that does, and every request the library made
 * without going through `askTheServer` would go looking for it.

 * and it asks with a `URL` where a caller may be expecting a string.
 *
 * Every request leaves on the page's own origin. In a browser that is the server, because the server
 * served the page. In a client that serves its own pages it is that client, which passes what it
 * hears on to the server in the process that owns the window — so a cookie is still a cookie, and
 * nothing here is cross-origin either way.

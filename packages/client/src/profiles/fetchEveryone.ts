 * The one request to do with signing in that does not go through better-auth's client, and
 * deliberately so. It is not a second way of getting a session: the route it calls looks up the
 * address behind the face and hands it to `auth.api.signInEmail`, so better-auth issues this session
 * as it issues every other. What the route buys is that the address never reaches the browser —
 * picking a face is the whole point of a wall of faces, and typing an email is not picking a face.
 *
 * Making it a better-auth plugin instead would move the same lookup and the same call behind the
 * library's surface, and put a Valence idea — a household with profiles — into a library that has no
 * opinion about them. So it stays here, as the exception, named.
 *
 * @param profileId - Who picked.
 * @param password - Their PIN, where the profile has one.
 * @param carried - What a desktop client sent somebody here with, where one did.
 * @returns Whether it worked, and why not where it did not.

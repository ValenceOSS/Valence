/**
 * What to do when an episode finishes: play the next one, ask first, or let it end.
 *
 * Kept apart from the player so the rule can be read and tested on its own. The order matters and is
 * easy to get wrong in passing: the question is asked *instead of* starting the next episode, never
 * over the top of one already playing. That is what makes it worth having — nothing is transcoded
 * for an empty room, and nothing is written to continue-watching for an episode nobody saw.
 *
 * @param following - The episode that would play next, or null where the series has run out.
 * @param carriedOn - How many episodes have followed on their own since somebody chose one.
 * @param askAfter - How many the profile allows before asking, or zero to never ask.
 * @returns What should happen.

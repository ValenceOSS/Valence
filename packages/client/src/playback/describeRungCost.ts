/**
 * Says what a rung costs, in the two units a viewer actually reasons in.
 *
 * The bitrate is what decides whether a stream keeps up on the line it is being pulled down, and
 * the size is what decides whether it is worth pulling at all. Most people have an intuition for
 * one of those and not the other, so both are offered rather than picking a favourite.
 *
 * A rung caps the bitrate rather than aiming at it, so it is written as a ceiling and a well
 * compressed film comes in under the number. The original is not a ceiling — it is simply what the
 * file is — so `isCeiling` turns that off and the figure is given plainly. Saying "up to" of a file
 * that already exists would be a hedge against nothing.
 *
 * The size is approximate either way. Nothing here records how large a file is on disk, so it is
 * derived from the bitrate and the runtime, which lands close but is not the number a directory
 * listing would give.
 *
 * @param options - The bitrate, how long the film runs, and whether the bitrate is a cap.
 * @returns The cost as a phrase, or the bitrate alone where the runtime is not known.

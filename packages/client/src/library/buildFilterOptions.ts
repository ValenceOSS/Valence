/**
 * Builds everything the filter rows offer from what the libraries actually hold, so a chip whose only
 * possible outcome is an empty page is never drawn. Kept apart from the page that draws them, so the
 * wording of a chip — and the decision not to offer one — can be read and tested without rendering a
 * search page.
 *
 * The exception is what this viewer gave something, which is offered whatever the libraries hold:
 * the server knows what everyone rated but the facets describe the catalogue, and a viewer who has
 * rated nothing is exactly who a row of their own ratings is useless to — which the empty page they
 * get tells them more plainly than a missing chip would.
 *
 * @param facets - What the server says there is to filter by.
 * @returns The chips for each row.

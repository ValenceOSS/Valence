/**
 * What this viewer has kept, and the one gesture that changes it. The list lives in the shared cache
 * rather than in this hook, so a heart filled on the home page is filled in the dialog and on the
 * favourites page without any of them being told.
 *
 * The change is written to the cache before the server is asked, so a heart fills the moment it is
 * pressed, and put back the same way if the server refuses. Only that one item is put back rather
 * than the whole list, since somebody keeping two things quickly should not have the first undone
 * by the second being refused. Any read still in flight is called off first, so a list that arrives
 * a moment later does not report the heart as empty again.
 *
 * Books are kept the same way, in a list of their own, so a book's heart and a film's are one
 * gesture with one behaviour.
 *
 * @param watcherId - Who is watching, so that their list is the one asked for.
 * @param what - Whether the list is of things to watch and listen to, or of books.
 * @returns What they have kept, and how to change it.

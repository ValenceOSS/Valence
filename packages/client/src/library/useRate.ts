/**
 * The one gesture that changes a rating, and nothing else.
 *
 * Deliberately holds no `useQuery`. Whoever gives a star is almost never whoever shows one — the
 * shell hands this to two dialogs and draws no star itself — and a hook that subscribed to every
 * rating in order to hand back a way of setting one would redraw the whole page on each press. That
 * is what it did: the press wrote to the very key the shell was reading, so rating something inside
 * a dialog redrew the library behind it. `useQueryClient` gives the cache without listening to it.
 *
 * The change is written to the cache before the server is asked, so a star fills on the press, and
 * only that one subject is put back if the server refuses. Any read still in flight is called off
 * first, so a list that arrives a moment later does not empty the star again.
 *
 * A rating the server took changes what the household gave the thing, so that figure is thrown away
 * and asked for again — the panel showing it does not have to know a rating was given.
 *
 * @param watcherId - Who is watching, so that their ratings are the ones written.
 * @returns How to give a star, or take one back.

 * Reads where on the picture a line sits, as one of the nine positions of a numeric keypad — 1 is

 * both spellings are still in circulation: the older one counts 1 to 3 along the bottom, 5 to 7
 * along the top and 9 to 11 through the middle. A script says which it means by which styles section
 * it carries, so the caller says which to read.
 *
 * @param raw - The alignment as the script wrote it.
 * @param isLegacy - Whether this script numbers them the older way.
 * @returns The keypad position, or null where it is not an alignment at all.

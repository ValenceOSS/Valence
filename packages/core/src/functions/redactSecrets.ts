/**
 * Removes from a line anything that would be a working credential, or a person, if the line left the
 * machine.
 *
 * Applied when a record is made rather than when one is shown, because a redaction at the point of
 * display is not a redaction — the record still exists, and a download or a database query hands it
 * over intact.
 *
 * What it deliberately leaves alone is file paths. Almost every scan problem quotes one, and they are
 * most of what makes a log worth reading; stripping them would gut the feature. They do disclose the
 * library layout and every title on the disk, which is a matter for the warning at the point of
 * export rather than for this.
 *
 * An email keeps its domain and loses the part that names somebody, since the domain helps explain a
 * delivery failure and does not identify who watched what.
 *
 * `auth`, `sig` and `session` are words before they are secrets, and a log line is written as
 * `session: what happened`. Reading that as an assignment took the next word out of every session
 * the media service logged, which is where a transcode says what it decided to do. So those three
 * are redacted where something is assigned to them with `=`, which is how a query string and an
 * environment carry them, and left alone after a colon. The forms that are only ever a credential —
 * `session_token`, `authorization`, `signature` — are redacted either way, and a bare `Bearer` or a
 * cookie is caught before any of this by a rule of its own.
 *
 * @param text - The line about to be written.
 * @returns The line with credentials and names removed.

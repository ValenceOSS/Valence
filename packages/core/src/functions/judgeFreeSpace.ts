 * Whether a download will fit, and whether it should give somebody pause.

 * A size in small grey text is documentation, not a warning. What prevents the mistake is the
 * comparison: "58 GB, and you have 41 GB free" is a different sentence from "58 GB", and it is the
 * one somebody acts on.
 *
 * Anything taking most of what is left is called tight rather than fine, because filling a device
 * to the last gigabyte breaks the next thing that needs room and nothing will connect that to this
 * decision. Where the free space is not known — a browser that would not say — nothing is claimed.
 *
 * @param options - What it would cost, and what there is.
 * @returns Whether it fits, is tight, will not fit, or cannot be judged.

/**
 * What to tell the room about this player.
 *
 * The important part is what it refuses to say. While a stream is being rebuilt — a quality change,
 * a different audio track, a fresh session — the element's position is not where the viewer is; it
 * is zero, or wherever the last stream left it. Reported as fact, that number is followed: the room
 * measures itself against whoever keeps time, so a host who has momentarily lost their place takes
 * everybody with them. The last position known to be real is reported instead, and the player says
 * plainly that it cannot play yet.
 *
 * The position reported is where the picture on screen is, not where the playback clock says it is.
 * Those are the same thing on a well-built stream and are not on a badly-built one: two sessions of
 * the same film can put the same second of clock against different frames, depending on where each
 * was cut and how its timestamps were written. A room that agrees on the clock and disagrees on the
 * picture is not synchronised, whatever the numbers say, so the frame is what is compared.
 *
 * Readiness asks the browser rather than counting seconds. A buffer target is the wrong question
 * near the end of a film, or at the end of what has been transcoded so far, where the buffer will
 * never reach it and the room would wait for a player that is in fact perfectly able to start.
 * `HAVE_FUTURE_DATA` is the browser's own answer to whether it could play now, which is the
 * question being asked; a comfortable buffer is accepted as well, for engines that are shy with it.
 *
 * @param player - What the element and its session currently say, including how far the frame on
 *   screen sits from the playback clock.
 * @returns What to report.

 * inventing it on the browser's behalf, so in practice the only ceiling is a rung somebody pinned.
 * Resolution is not a ceiling at all, for the same reason and more plainly: only a rung somebody
 * pinned can force the picture smaller. `profile.maxWidth` is the display's own size, which is a sensible
 * thing to encode towards once something else has decided to encode, and a poor reason to decide
 * it — 4K into a 1440p panel is downsampled by the display and looks better for it than anything
 * re-encoded to fit would, which is why every streaming service offers the choice rather than
 * hiding it.
 *
 * It used to be a veto, and this comment argued against it while the code below did it anyway: a 4K
 * film was decoded, scaled and re-encoded so that a panel which cannot show 4K could be sent
 * something slightly smaller than 4K. What the device genuinely cannot decode is enforced
 * elsewhere, through codec support and level limits — a level is a real statement about a decoder,
 * where a panel size is a statement about a piece of glass.

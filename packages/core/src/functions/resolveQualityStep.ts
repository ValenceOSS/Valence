 * figure regardless, that content is not clamped so much as starved — and it is starved by an
 * assumption nobody stated at the point of choosing.
 *
 * Not proportional. Doubling the frames does not double what they cost, because consecutive frames
 * at high rates are more alike and so cheaper to predict from each other.

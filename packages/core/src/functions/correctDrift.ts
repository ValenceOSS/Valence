 * error it corrects, and without one the rate hunts audibly. Widening it by measured jitter stops a
 * viewer on mobile data being corrected for noise in the measurement rather than real drift.

 * What to do about a picture that has drifted from the party's reference.
 *
 * Three bands, and the middle one is the point of the whole thing: rather than jumping, the rate is
 * nudged a few percent so the picture quietly catches up or falls behind. A viewer notices a jump;
 * they do not notice three percent. Only when it is hopeless does it snap, because a second out is
 * worse than a visible correction.
 *
 * Nothing is done while seeking or stalled — correcting then means fighting the buffer, and the
 * measurement is meaningless anyway.
 *
 * @param behindByMs - How far behind the reference this picture is; negative means ahead.
 * @param jitterMs - How unsteady the clock measurements are.
 * @param isSeeking - Whether the picture is already moving somewhere.
 * @param isStalled - Whether it has run out of buffer.
 * @returns What to do.

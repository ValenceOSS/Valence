# Both halves of Valence run in one container: one GPU device
# mapping, one log stream, one restart policy. They are siblings started by
# this shell, not a parent and a child — neither can find the other by walking
# the process tree, which is why what Valence costs is read from the cgroup and
# not from a process walk. If either dies, the whole container dies so the
# orchestrator restarts both together rather than leaving an API that cannot
# play anything.
#
# Except where the transcoder runs somewhere else: natively on a Mac or a
# Windows PC, which is the only way it reaches the hardware there (VAL-338).
# Then this container is the server alone, and TRANSCODER_URL says where the
# other half is.

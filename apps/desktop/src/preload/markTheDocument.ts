/**
 * Marks a document as one this client is showing, as soon as there is a document to mark.
 *
 * A preload script runs before the page it is preloading exists. At that point the document has been
 * created but nothing has been parsed into it, so there is no root element to put anything on:
 * reaching for one throws, and a script that throws here takes everything after it with it — the
 * listeners the window forwards through, and the bridge the pages are handed.
 *
 * So where the root is not there yet it is waited for rather than assumed. It arrives at the very
 * start of parsing, long before anything the server sent has run, which is what this has to beat.
 *
 * @param within - The document to mark.

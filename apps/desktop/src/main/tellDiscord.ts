/**
 * Says what somebody is watching in their Discord status, where Discord is running.
 *
 * It is a socket the Discord client opens on the same machine — a named pipe on Windows, a Unix
 * socket everywhere else — which is why this lives out here and not in the page. A browser cannot
 * reach either, and no amount of the window being a browser changes that.
 *
 * Nothing here is required to work. Discord is not running for most people most of the time, the
 * socket may be any of ten, and it goes away when Discord quits. Every failure is quiet and every
 * one is recoverable: the connection is dropped, and the next thing somebody plays tries again from
 * the beginning. A media player that complained about a chat application would be a worse media
 * player.
 *
 * @param temporary - Where this machine keeps this user's temporary files, which is where Discord
 *   listens on a Mac. Passed in rather than read from the environment, which does not always carry
 *   it.
 * @param openedAt - When Valence opened, which browsing counts from however often it is said again.
 * @returns How to say what is playing, and how to stop.

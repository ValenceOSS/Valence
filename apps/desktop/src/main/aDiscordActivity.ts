/**
 * Writes what somebody is watching the way Discord shows it.
 *
 * The programme goes on the top line and the episode below it, because that is the order Discord
 * draws them in and the order somebody would say them. A film has only the top line.
 *
 * The times are sent rather than a progress figure, so Discord's own clock counts down without Valence
 * telling it anything again — a presence that had to be pushed every second would be a presence that
 * stutters whenever the machine is busy.
 *
 * The poster is not sent. Discord draws artwork only from images registered against the application
 * in advance, and a self-hosted library's posters are neither registered nor reachable from the
 * internet — sending a URL to one would either fail or publish somebody's server address. The Valence
 * logo is what is left, and it is the honest answer rather than a compromise.
 *
 * Somebody who has Valence open but is not watching anything gets the top line and the logo and nothing
 * else. No clock, because there is nothing to count towards, and no button, because there is nothing
 * in particular to send anybody to.
 *
 * The poster is drawn where the catalogue has one, because it is what somebody would recognise from
 * across a room. Discord fetches it for itself rather than passing the address on, and only the
 * catalogue's own image host is named — a self-hosted library is not reachable from the internet,
 * and its address is nobody else's business. The logo stands in where there is no poster.
 *
 * A pause takes the clock off rather than freezing it. Discord counts from the times it was given
 * and has no notion of being stopped, so a paused status left with them would go on counting towards
 * an end that is no longer coming — better to say what is open and let the missing clock say the
 * rest.
 *
 * A watch party is said in the line somebody reads, and sent as Discord's own group besides. The
 * group is the field made for it, but Discord draws it only where an activity says somebody is
 * playing something, and this one says they are watching — which is worth more than the little
 * figure, because it is what the card leads with. The field is still sent: it is true, it costs
 * nothing, and wherever Discord does draw it, it will be right.
 *
 * @param playing - What is happening, or nothing where the status should come down.
 * @param version - Which Valence this is, which is what the picture says when somebody rests on it.
 * @returns The activity to send, or nothing to clear it.

 * Node can do. A media client loads artwork and subtitles from a server somebody else runs, so this
 * is not a formality.

 * The frame is hidden on macOS so the window reads as an application rather than as a browser, and

 * The developer tools are shut in an installed build, shortcut and menu alike. Leaving only the menu

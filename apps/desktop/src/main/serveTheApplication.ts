/**
 * Serves this client's own pages, and passes everything it asks of Valence through to the server.
 *
 * This is what makes the application a host rather than a window onto somebody else's pages, and it
 * is the answer to the thing that made the previous attempt painful. Every request the page makes —
 * an API call, a poster, a subtitle, a segment of video — leaves on the same origin, so nothing is
 * cross-origin, no preflight happens, and no cookie is dropped for being third-party. The requests
 * that go on to Valence are made out here in the main process, where none of those rules exist at all
 * and where one session holds the cookie for every one of them.
 *
 * A path that belongs to Valence is proxied. A path that names a file this machine is holding is
 * answered from the disk without the server being involved at all, which is what makes a download
 * something that can be watched rather than something that was fetched. Everything else is this
 * client's own bundle, and a path that names nothing gets the document, because the router in the
 * page owns the address.
 *
 * Whether the server answered is noted on the way past. This is the only place that sees every
 * request Valence makes, so it is the only place that can tell a server which has gone away from a
 * server which said no — and telling those apart is the difference between offering somebody their
 * downloads and drawing them an error.
 *
 * An address on any other host is fetched as itself over https. A page written for a browser names
 * things without a scheme — `//www.gstatic.com/…` is how the cast sender is asked for — and under a
 * scheme of our own that resolves to a host of our own, which this client would otherwise answer
 * with its own document. A page that asked for a script and was handed HTML fails at the first `<`.
 *
 * A body is read before it is sent on. It arrives as a stream, and passing a stream onward needs the
 * request declared as one; the bodies here are a device profile and a place in a film, so reading
 * them first costs nothing and works.

/**
 * Turns a file being read off the disk into a body a response can carry.
 *
 * Node's own conversion produces a stream typed by Node's stream library rather than by the web, and
 * the two are the same idea described twice. Wrapping it by hand is a few lines and keeps the
 * boundary honest, where declaring one to be the other would only silence it.
 *
 * Backpressure is kept: the file is paused when the page has taken as much as it wants and resumed
 * when it asks for more. Without it, playing a four gigabyte film would read a four gigabyte film
 * into memory as fast as the disk could manage.
 *
 * @param from - The file being read.
 * @returns The same bytes, as something a response will take.

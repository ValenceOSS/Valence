 * something it could have found out in a few milliseconds, and the screen that asks is the first
 * thing they see.

 * Only this machine is looked at. Sweeping a network for open ports is a different kind of act
 * altogether — it is what a scanner does, it takes far longer than anybody will wait, and on a
 * shared network it means knocking on machines that are not ours to knock on. Somebody whose Valence is
 * elsewhere is asked, which is the one case worth asking about.

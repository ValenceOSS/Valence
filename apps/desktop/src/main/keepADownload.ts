/**
 * How big the whole thing is, according to an answer that may only be part of it.
 *
 * Two headers say different things and only one of them is the answer. A partial answer states the
 * length of the whole file after the slash in its content range, while its content length is the
 * length of this piece alone — so the first is used as it stands and the second has to have what is
 * already on the disk added back to it. Reading a piece as the whole makes a resumed transfer look
 * like a much smaller file that finishes at once, at whatever fraction it stopped at.
 *
 * @param answer - What the server said.
 * @param already - How much is on the disk, which this answer does not include.
 * @param startingOver - Whether the server ignored the range and sent everything again, in which
 * case what was on the disk is about to be overwritten rather than added to.
 * @returns The length of the whole file, or nothing where the server did not say.

/**
 * Fetches a prepared file to the disk, and can be stopped and picked up again later.
 *
 * The transfer is made here rather than handed to the browser's own downloader, which is the whole
 * point of the exercise: a file the application fetched is a file the application knows the name of,
 * can check is still there, and can play. One the browser fetched is somewhere in a folder, under
 * whatever name avoided a collision, and is gone as far as Valence is concerned.
 *
 * Resuming asks for the rest with a range and appends. A server that ignores the range and sends the
 * whole file again says so by answering with all of it rather than part of it, and the answer is to
 * start the file again rather than append a second copy to the end of the first — which would
 * produce a file of exactly the right length made of the wrong bytes.
 *
 * Progress is reported on a timer rather than per chunk. A chunk is a few kilobytes and a film is
 * millions of them, and telling the window about each one costs more than the transfer.
 *
 * Stopping is not failing. What is on the disk stays there, and the caller is told how much of it
 * there is, because that is where the next attempt begins. The loop watches for it itself rather
 * than waiting to be interrupted: whether aborting the request tears down a body already being read
 * is up to whoever implemented the fetch, and a transfer that carried on to the end of a four
 * gigabyte film after somebody pressed pause would be a poor way to find that out.
 *
 * @param asked - Where to fetch from, where to put it, how much is already there, and who to tell.
 * @returns A way to stop it, and how it went.

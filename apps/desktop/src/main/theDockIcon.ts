/**
 * Puts Valence's icon in the dock, for the platform that takes it from the running application rather
 * than from the window.
 *
 * A window's icon is not a dock icon on macOS: the dock reads the bundle, and while this is being
 * worked on the bundle is Electron's own — so the dock shows an atom no matter what the window was
 * given. A packaged Valence takes its own icon from its own bundle and never needs this, which is
 * exactly why it is easy to leave broken for everybody who runs it from source.
 *
 * The macOS artwork, not the square one. Every other platform draws an icon to the edges of its
 * box; macOS leaves about a fifth of the canvas empty around it, and reserves that room for the
 * shadow and for making every icon in the dock look the same size. An icon drawn to its edges is
 * not richer, it is simply larger than its neighbours.
 *
 * Does nothing once packaged, which is what the paragraph above always said and what the code did
 * not do. A packaged app has no `build` directory inside it — the artwork is the bundle's own by
 * then, and that folder is what the bundle was made from rather than something carried within it.
 * Asking for it there threw, and the throw came out through startup and took the window with it.

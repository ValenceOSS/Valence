/**
 * What this machine is holding, asked of the process that holds it.
 *
 * Nothing here knows where a file is or how it got there. The window is not given a path, and could
 * not open one if it were: a renderer reads what its own scheme serves it and nothing else, which is
 * the point of a renderer. So a file is addressed the same way a poster or a segment is — as a path
 * on this client's own origin — and the process that owns the disk decides what that means.
 *
 * What comes back across the bridge is parsed rather than trusted. It is our own main process at the
 * other end, but it is reading a file on disk that anything with a text editor can reach, and a
 * download list that will not draw is a worse outcome than one that is short.
 *
 * @returns Where this client's files are kept.

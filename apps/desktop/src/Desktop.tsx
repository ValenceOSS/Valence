/**
 * Valence, drawn by this client rather than fetched from a server as pages.
 *
 * The application is a package and this is a host for it — the same one the browser is, with
 * different answers to the four things a host is asked: where preferences live, what to call this
 * client, which client this is, and how to open a socket. Everything above that is the same code
 * running in both places.
 *
 * What a server is asked for goes out on this client's own origin and is passed on by the process
 * that owns the window. So nothing here is cross-origin, no cookie is dropped for being somebody
 * else's, and signing in is an ordinary request rather than a negotiation between two origins.
 *
 * The strip along the top is this client's too, and for the same reason: a browser gives a window
 * somewhere to be picked up by and a frameless one has nowhere. It draws nothing and lies over the
 * page rather than above it, so no screen pays height for a bar it never sees.
 *
 * The one screen this client owns is the first one: which Valence is yours. It has to be ours, because
 * until it is answered there is no server to ask anything of. Nothing else is drawn until it is
 * answered — a client with no server has no library, no account and no downloads, and the shelf of
 * downloads in particular is an empty room on a machine that has never been given anywhere to fetch
 * from. What it offers on that screen is found by the process that owns the window — a page served
 * from a scheme of its own cannot go knocking on `localhost` to see what answers, and would be
 * refused for being somebody else's origin. The same process hears the servers that announce
 * themselves on the network, which a page has no socket to hear with either. Where nothing is found
 * it is the same screen with the box alone, because somebody whose server is elsewhere still has to
 * be asked — though what they were pointed at before is offered too, being on this device already.
 *
 * An address that no longer answers is asked about again, but only where there is nothing on this
 * device. Offline mode is built around a shelf of downloads, and offering it an empty shelf is
 * showing somebody an empty room and calling it a feature — the honest question at that point is
 * where Valence went, not which of the nothing they would like to watch. Somebody who does have
 * downloads keeps them, because a laptop on a plane has not mistyped its address.
 *
 * That question is followed rather than asked once. A client that has made no request yet has no
 * grounds to call its server missing, so it starts out assuming one is there and learns otherwise
 * from the first request that fails — which is after this has been drawn. Reading it as the window
 * opens therefore only ever read back the assumption, and an address that was dead all along drew
 * the empty shelf anyway.
 *
 * Whoever is asked again is shown the address that stopped answering rather than an empty box. They
 * came here to correct a detail or to wait for a machine to come back, not to remember what they
 * typed months ago.
 *
 * The chosen theme is put on the document from here as well as from the application's own root,
 * because the screen this client owns is drawn instead of that root rather than inside it.

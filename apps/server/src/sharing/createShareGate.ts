/**
 * Lets somebody holding a share link reach what was shared with them, and refuses everything else.
 * Runs only for a request with no signed-in session, so nothing here can widen what an account
 * already has — a share is a way in for somebody with no account, not a second set of permissions
 * for somebody who has one.
 *
 * Three things are checked on every request rather than once at the start, which is what makes
 * revocation and expiry immediate for a stream already playing:
 *
 * * the link still exists, has not been withdrawn, has not expired, and either has room left or is
 *   being asked for by somebody already let in — a cap counts people rather than requests, so the
 *   person it admitted is not refused by it a moment later;
 * * the route is one a guest may ask for at all, which is decided by naming what is open rather
 *   than what is closed, so a route added later is shut to a share until somebody opens it;
 * * the thing being asked for is inside what the link covers.
 *
 * A request naming a tab rather than an item — the presence heartbeat, and the note that a tab has
 * stopped watching — is checked against the link the tab itself came in on. Those routes are
 * addressed by a client identifier and nothing else, and the signed-in path checks one against the
 * account that owns it; a guest owns no account, so `null === null` would have let any guest drive
 * any other guest's card.
 *
 * @param shares - Where links are resolved.
 * @param sessions - Which share started which playback session.
 * @param itemOf - How to look up the item a request names, to check it against the link's scope.
 * @returns The middleware.

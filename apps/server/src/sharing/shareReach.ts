/**
 * Decides what a guest holding a share link may ask for. Everything is refused unless it is named
 * here, so a route added later is closed to a share until somebody deliberately opens it — the
 * opposite way round from listing what a share may not reach, which fails open the moment the
 * library grows a new endpoint.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing still need checking after this: a request naming an item has to be checked
 * against what the share covers, and a request naming a session has to be checked against the
 * sessions that share itself started. This says which, rather than deciding either, so that the
 * check happens against live state rather than against a path.
 *
 * A session identifier is matched loosely on purpose. An item is named by a real identifier and is
 * checked as one, but a session is whatever the playback service called it — `direct-<item>` for a
 * file played as it is, and the media service's own name for a transcode. Insisting on a shape here
 * refused every manifest and segment a guest asked for, while the check that actually protects them
 * — whether this share started that session — happened not at all.
 *
 * @param request - What is being asked for.
 * @returns Whether it is allowed outright, refused outright, or allowed subject to a check.

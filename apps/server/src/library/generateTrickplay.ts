/**
 * Renders one item's sheets, asking the media service to begin and then asking again until it says
 * they are ready.
 *
 * Nothing waits on the render itself. A request to the media service is given up on after a minute,
 * and a feature film takes longer than that to draw: a 4K remux measured sixty-three seconds, so it
 * failed every time by three. Asking it to render in the background and saying so each time it is
 * asked costs one quick answer every few seconds and has no length of film it cannot survive.
 *
 * Asked for as long as it takes, with no deadline of its own. Any number would be a guess at how
 * long a stranger's film takes on a machine nobody has seen, and being wrong about it fails work
 * that was going fine — which is what a four hour library of 4K remuxes looked like. A render that
 * genuinely fails says so instead: the media service remembers what went wrong and answers the next
 * ask with it, so this ends on a fault rather than on a clock.
 *
 * @param options - The media service, what to render, and whether the scan has been stopped.
 * @returns Whether the sheets were rendered, which is false where the scan was stopped.

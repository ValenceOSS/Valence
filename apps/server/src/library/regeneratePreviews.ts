/**
 * Cuts one clip, asking the media service to begin and then asking again until it says it is done.
 *
 * Nothing waits on the render itself. Holding the request open for the whole encode was what made a
 * scan impossible to stop: the call had no clock and no way to be abandoned, so a cancelled job sat
 * in it until every clip in flight had finished — minutes, and sometimes far longer. Asking again
 * every few seconds costs one quick answer each time and can be given up between any two of them.
 *
 * A render that fails says so: the media service remembers what went wrong and answers the next ask
 * with it, so this ends on a fault rather than on a clock. The same shape the sheets use.
 *
 * @param options - The media service, what to cut, and whether the scan has been stopped.
 * @returns Whether the clip was cut, which is false where the scan was stopped.

/**
 * Says what kind of thing one item is, which nothing stores.
 *
 * `media_item` has no discriminator column — an episode is told from a film by having a series
 * behind it, an extra by saying which sort of extra it is, and everything else is decided by the
 * library it sits in. A book is not a media item
 * at all, so it never reaches here through the same scan; it is admitted because a
 * subscriber filtering on kind has to be able to name one.
 *
 * A file in a programme library that no series could be read from is a video rather than a film.
 * Failing to parse a name is not evidence that something is a film — it is evidence of nothing —
 * and calling it one puts an episode whose name was written out in words, or a double episode the
 * parser did not recognise, on the films shelf beside the features.
 *
 * @param item - What was found, so far as the scan knows it.
 * @param libraryKind - What the library it landed in reads.
 * @returns The kind to report.

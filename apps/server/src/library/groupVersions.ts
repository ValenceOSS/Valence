 * reads the same shelf, and it is the only arrangement that says so unambiguously: files that merely
 * sit together are films that merely sit together.
 *
 * An episode is never a cut of anything, however its folder is named: a programme kept as
 * `ted/ted - S01E05 - …` has every file beginning with the folder's name, and is still a list of
 * episodes rather than one of them in twenty versions. Jellyfin keeps versions to films for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * One of them has to be the film itself, since the others hang off a row rather than off a folder.
 * The one named exactly after the folder is taken where there is one, and otherwise the first by
 * name, so that the same shelf reads the same way on every scan.
 *
 * @param paths - Every media file in the library.
 * @param skip - The files already spoken for, which are extras rather than cuts of anything.
 * @returns Which film each version belongs to and what to call it, for the files that are versions.

/**
 * Makes a chapter of somebody else's book safe to put in a page of ours.
 *
 * A book is a file from a stranger, and its chapters are arbitrary XHTML that ends up on the same
 * origin as somebody's library. Scripts, event handlers, embedded frames and anything that can fetch
 * are removed rather than trusted, by a sanitiser that is maintained for the purpose — hand-written
 * sanitising is how this goes wrong.
 *
 * **The book's own stylesheets are dropped**, not sanitised. Valence decides how a book is set — size,
 * leading, margins, and whether the page is light, sepia or dark — and a stylesheet that fought that
 * would win in places and lose in others. It also removes a whole class of things to get wrong:
 * there is no CSS to escape from if there is no CSS.
 *
 * Pictures are kept, and their addresses are rewritten to point back at Valence, because a book's
 * pictures live inside the book and no browser can reach in there.
 *
 * Links are kept only where they lead somewhere a reader can follow: out to the web, or to another
 * place in the same book, which `linkFor` rewrites into an address the reader understands. A link to
 * a file the book does not hold keeps its words and loses its address.
 *
 * @param html - The chapter as the book wrote it.
 * @param addressFor - Turns a path inside the book into one this server serves.
 * @param linkFor - Turns a link to somewhere in the book into one the reader follows.
 * @returns The chapter, safe to render.

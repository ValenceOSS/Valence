/**
 * Reads a library of books into the shelf.
 *
 * Shaped like the scan that reads films, and skipping in the same way: a file whose size and time
 * are what they were last time is left alone, so a library of thousands that has gained two costs
 * two. What is different is what a file is asked. There is no probing here — FFmpeg reads none of
 * these formats — so a chapter is opened, counted, and closed.
 *
 * A book's layout is decided by the first chapter that opens: fixed where it paginates ahead of
 * time, reflowing where it lays itself out against a screen. A folder holding both is not something
 * that happens, and where it does the rest is reported as a problem rather than quietly mixed.
 *
 * What a file states about itself is preferred over what its path suggested, the same way a
 * catalogue is preferred over a filename for a film, and the same way Komga and Kavita both read a
 * comic. A series named inside the file wins outright; a volume's own title is taken only where the
 * file is a book in itself, since one chapter's title is not the name of what holds it.
 *
 * @param options - The library, where it is, what to read it with, and where to put it.
 * @returns What the scan changed.

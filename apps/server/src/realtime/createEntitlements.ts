/**
 * Resolves what an account may do, remembered only briefly. A socket that checked permissions once
 * when it opened would go on delivering an admin feed to somebody whose role was taken away an hour
 * ago, so entitlement is re-read rather than remembered for the life of the connection.
 *
 * Re-reading on every message of a four-thousand-item scan would mean four thousand queries, hence
 * the short window. Immediacy where it matters comes from `forget`, called when a role actually
 * changes, rather than from making the window small enough to hide the problem.
 *
 * @param resolve - How permissions are read for an account.
 * @param now - The clock, injected so this can be tested without waiting.
 * @param ttlMs - How long a reading stays good.
 * @returns The entitlement reader.

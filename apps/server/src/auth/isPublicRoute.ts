/**
 * Whether a request may be answered without a session — signing in, first-run setup, and the handful
 * of things a browser asks for before anybody has signed in. Matched on both method and path, so
 * that reading something openly does not also mean writing it.
 *
 * Who lives here is among them while the server says so. A wall of faces is how a household sharing
 * one television expects to be met — pick yourself and watch — so it is the way in a server opens
 * with. It is a setting rather than a rule, because the same wall tells anybody who asks every
 * profile's name, picture and identifier, which is a list of who to try passwords against and who to
 * address a party invitation to; a server facing the open internet can shut it.
 *
 * The picture behind the way in follows the faces rather than standing apart from them. It is
 * whatever the household chose to greet itself with, which is as often a family photograph as a
 * poster, so closing the wall closes it too.
 *
 * The generated avatars stay open: they are drawn from a style and a seed in the address and say
 * nothing about anybody. So does signing in as a face, which needs the identifier already and is a
 * password check rather than a way of finding one.
 *
 * @param method The HTTP method, as the request reports it.
 * @param path The request path, without its query.
 * @param showsFaces Whether this server shows who lives here before anybody has signed in.

/**
 * Middleware that requires a session for everything the allowlist does not excuse.
 *
 * Where a share gate is given, somebody with no session is handed to it rather than refused
 * outright — that is how a link works for a guest with no account. It runs only after the session
 * has been looked for and not found, so a share can never widen what somebody signed in already
 * has, and a signed-in request never touches it at all.
 *
 * Whether the faces are open is asked per request rather than read once at startup, so turning the
 * setting off shuts them for the next request instead of at the next restart.
 *
 * @param auth - The authentication layer to resolve the session against.
 * @param showsFaces - Whether this server shows who lives here before anybody has signed in.
 * @param shareGate - What to try for a request carrying no session, where sharing is enabled.
 * @returns The middleware.

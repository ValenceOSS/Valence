/**
 * What a file being kept is encoded for.
 *
 * Not the device that asked. A stream is negotiated against the thing about to play it, because it
 * is about to play it; a kept file outlives that entirely — copied to a phone, watched on a laptop,
 * handed to somebody else — so it is made for the widest thing that plays rather than the narrowest
 * thing that asked.
 *
 * H.264 and AAC in MP4, which is the combination every device made this century will open. It is
 * not the most efficient: HEVC would be a third smaller for the same picture. But a download that
 * will not open is worth nothing at all, and the one place somebody finds that out is the place
 * they cannot do anything about it.
 *
 * Anything the source already is and this can carry is copied rather than re-encoded, which the
 * negotiator works out from this exactly as it does for a stream — so a file that is already H.264
 * in MP4 is a copy, and takes seconds rather than an hour.
 *
 * @returns The profile a kept file is made for.

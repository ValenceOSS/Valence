 * Queues a server-wide job under its own kind as a singleton, so pressing the same button twice
 * joins the run already queued rather than starting a second sweep beside it. Different kinds stay
 * independent: a cache cleanup and a session cleanup may run at once.
 *
 * One of a kind runs at a time, so asking twice gets nothing back the second time. The answer used
 * to be an invented id — `pending-<kind>` — which was worse than no answer: nothing has that id, so
 * reading its state says "unknown", the client reads unknown as finished and stops watching, and
 * the work carries on untracked. The job already doing it is found and returned instead.
 *
 * @param jobs - The queue to put it on.
 * @param kind - The job being asked for.
 * @returns The job doing the work, with no id only where there is none and none could be started.

/**
 * Says what went wrong in one line, following the causes underneath.
 *
 * Node reports every network fault as "fetch failed" and puts what actually happened — a timeout, a
 * refused connection, a socket closed underneath — in the cause beneath it. Reporting only the top
 * of that chain tells an operator that something failed and nothing about what, which is the
 * difference between a problem they can act on and one they can only pass on.
 *
 * An address that resolves several ways is tried several ways, and the failures arrive gathered in
 * an AggregateError, which carries no message of its own and holds every attempt in `errors`
 * instead of in `cause`. Following only `cause` there ends the chain on an empty line and reports
 * the bare "fetch failed" this exists to avoid.
 *
 * Written for the scan and now used by anything that reports a fault to an operator, which is why
 * it lives beside the log rather than beside the scanner.
 *
 * @param error - What was thrown.
 * @returns What went wrong, with its causes, as one line.

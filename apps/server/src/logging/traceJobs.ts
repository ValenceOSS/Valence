/**
 * Wraps every job handler so that whatever it logs says which job it was.
 *
 * Done to the whole set at once rather than to each handler, because there are twenty of them and a
 * handler added later would otherwise write lines that belong to no job — which is the state the
 * logs were in before any of this. A job that was enqueued for a library says which one as well, so
 * everything a library's jobs wrote can be found by the library.
 *
 * @param handlers - The handlers as written.
 * @param scope - What carries the context while a job runs.
 * @returns The same handlers, each running inside its own context.

 * Says what a subtitle file was read as and what decided that, for the files where anything was

 *
 * A file read as UTF-8 is not worth reporting: either it said so with a byte order mark or it proved
 * it by decoding cleanly, and in both cases nothing was assumed. Everything else was a decision
 * Valence made on the file's behalf, and a wrong one shows up as mojibake with nothing else to
 * explain it — so the decision is said out loud where an operator can see it.
 *
 * @param decoded - What the file was read as.
 * @returns What to report, or null where nothing was guessed.

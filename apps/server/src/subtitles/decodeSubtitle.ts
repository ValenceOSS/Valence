 * Reads a subtitle file as text, working out what it was written in rather than assuming UTF-8.

 * Most of what circulates for anything not English is in a legacy encoding, and reading one of those
 * as UTF-8 does not fail — the invalid bytes become replacement characters and the file parses, so
 * mojibake is served with nothing reporting a problem.
 *
 * Three questions, in the order of how much they can be trusted. A byte order mark is the file
 * saying outright what it is and settles it. Failing that, UTF-8 validates itself, so a file that
 * decodes cleanly as UTF-8 is UTF-8. Only then is anything guessed, and the guess is informed: a
 * subtitle usually names its language in its filename, and a language implies the encoding its
 * subtitles are written in far more often than not.
 *
 * What is left over is read as windows-1252. Every byte maps to something there, so a file always
 * reads as something rather than failing, and for the Western European languages that dominate what
 * has no language in its name it is also the right answer.

/**
 * A lock on a library that every Valence process against one database can see, so that two of them
 * do not do the same work at the same time.
 *
 * The lock inside the process is a map in memory, which guards the process holding it and nothing
 * else. One server is all there has ever been, so that has been enough — but an outgoing and an
 * incoming process overlap for a few seconds during a restart, and a scan runs for minutes, so a
 * redeploy can genuinely catch one mid-flight and the new process would start it again.
 *
 * A lock held by a database session is the answer that needs no new infrastructure: the queue is
 * already in this database, the lock is a name rather than a table, and the database drops it by
 * itself when the connection holding it dies — Postgres's advisory locks and MySQL's named locks
 * both, which `#dialect/openLockSession` speaks to. That last part is what a lease table gets wrong
 * — it has to guess an expiry, and guessing short cuts off a live job while guessing long blocks the
 * library after a crash.
 *
 * Asking never waits, because waiting would hold the connection for as long as the other process
 * works and there are only so many connections. A caller told the lock is held elsewhere puts its
 * job back with a delay instead.
 *
 * Every lock is taken on one connection kept for the purpose rather than one checked out per job.
 * A session lock belongs to the session that took it, so the taking and the releasing have to
 * happen on the same connection, and checking one out for the length of a job would mean six of
 * them held for minutes while a library is worked through — most of a default pool, taken from the
 * requests that need it. One session can hold as many of these locks at once as it likes.
 *
 * It follows that the lock in the process has to be taken first. A session that asks for a key it
 * already holds is given it a second time, so what keeps this honest within one process is the
 * cheaper lock, which lets only one job per key get this far.
 *
 * @param options - Where to get the connection the locks are taken on.
 * @returns The lock.

/**
 * Starts the job queue and registers a worker for every kind of background work Valence does — scans,
 * previews, thumbnails, artwork, webhook deliveries. Work outlives the request that asked for it and
 * survives a restart, which is the whole reason a queue exists rather than a promise.
 *
 * `onStarted` is awaited and the other two are not, which is not an oversight. Everything said about
 * a run afterwards — its progress, and that it finished — is said about a row that has to exist
 * first, and these callbacks write to Postgres through a pool: two queries nobody waited for run on
 * whichever connections are free, in whichever order those finish. A job that takes milliseconds
 * therefore raced its own history. "Check the transcoder" is one reachability ping, and where its
 * insert landed last the progress and the finish had already updated nothing, leaving a run that
 * showed no progress and said RUNNING for ever. Waiting here puts the row in front of everything
 * that amends it, and costs one insert against work that was about to touch the disk anyway.
 *
 * @param options - The database to keep the queue in, and the handlers for each kind of job.

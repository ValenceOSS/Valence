/**
 * Names the lock a piece of work takes out on a library.
 *
 * Reading, re-reading and reading the one folder a request was filed into share one, because they
 * are the things that decide which items a library has and two of them at once would fight over
 * that. Everything else — clips, thumbnails,
 * lettering, intros — makes artefacts for items that already exist, works from what is outstanding
 * rather than from a list it was handed, and so has a lock of its own.
 *
 * It used to be the bare library id for all of them. That is what made a scan wait for the
 * thumbnails: not the job queue, which was happy to run both, but this lock inside the process.
 *
 * @param kind - The job asking.
 * @param libraryId - The library it is working on.
 * @returns The key to serialise it under.

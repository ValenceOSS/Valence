/**
 * Watches how each kind of job is faring and speaks up when a kind stops working entirely — once,
 * rather than on every failure.
 *
 * A job that failed today and a job that has never once succeeded are different conditions with
 * different answers, and nothing here could tell them apart: a scheduled queue failed twelve hundred
 * times over nine days without raising anything, because every failure looked like the first. This
 * counts failures in a row per kind, remembers whether the kind has ever worked, and reports the
 * crossing rather than the count.
 *
 * @param onStalled - Called once, when a kind has failed every time for long enough to mean it.
 * @param onWorking - Called once, when a stalled kind runs without failing.
 * @param stalledAfter - How many failures in a row it takes. Three by default, because a job is
 * retried twice before it is given up on: three failures is one firing that failed all the way
 * through rather than three separate bad days.
 * @returns The watch, to be told about every job that ends.

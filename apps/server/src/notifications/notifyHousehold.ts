/**
 * Tells the household something, by every means each person asked to be told by — in the app, by
 * push, or not at all. One thing that happened becomes as many deliveries as there are people
 * wanting to hear about it, and a transport failing for one person does not stop the others.
 *
 * `only` narrows it to particular people without narrowing anything else: what somebody asked to be
 * told about is still theirs to decide, so being named in an invitation is not a way around having
 * turned that kind of notification off.
 *
 * @param store Where notifications, preferences and browsers are kept.
 * @param event Which event this is, so preferences can be read against it.
 * @param title What the notification is called.
 * @param body The sentence the digest wrote.
 * @param link Where pressing it goes, where there is somewhere honest.
 * @param vapid The push identity, or null where the server has none.
 * @param send How to reach a push service, so a test need not.
 * @param onProblem Told when something could not be delivered.
 * @param announce Told who now has something waiting, so open tabs can hear about it at once.
 * @param only The people to tell, where this concerns some of the household rather than all of it. Preferences still decide how each of them hears it.

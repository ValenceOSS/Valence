 * The arguments that turn one fixture into another.

 * one: asking it to encode SubRip as `dvdsub` fails outright. So the bitmap formats it can encode —
 * VobSub and DVB — are reachable only from a bitmap source, and the fetched PGS sample is the only
 * one there is. Deriving them costs a few kilobytes and no further downloads.
 *
 * @param fixture - What to derive.
 * @param sourcePath - The fixture it is derived from.
 * @param outputPath - Where to write it.
 * @returns The arguments to pass to FFmpeg, without the binary itself.

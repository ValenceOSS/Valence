/**
 * Every fetched fixture at or below a tier.
 *
 * Nothing here is generated, because nothing here can be. PGS has a decoder in FFmpeg and no
 * encoder anywhere, and HE-AAC needs libfdk_aac, which the shipped build does not carry.
 *
 * Nor is any of it mirrored. Re-hosting Tier 1 would protect against URL rot, which
 * assumed freely licensed material; these are test signals and clips of unstated provenance, so
 * they are fetched into the local cache on demand and never redistributed. The cost is that a dead
 * URL becomes a skipped test rather than a cached one, which is the right trade for material we
 * have no licence to serve.
 *
 * @param tier - The highest tier to include.
 * @returns The fixtures to fetch, in a stable order.

/**
 * Says when the media service is about to start on an FFmpeg that is not the one Valence ships.
 *
 * Silence is the problem this exists against. Left unset the service falls back to whatever is on
 * PATH and keeps working, minus the filters that hold frames on the device — so the cost is real,
 * invisible, and looks exactly like hardware that cannot do better.
 *
 * Both variables are checked, because the service reads them independently: setting only one
 * transcodes with Valence's build while still probing with another.
 *
 * @param options - What the environment says, and how to tell whether a path is really there.
 * @returns The warning to print, or undefined when both point at something that exists.

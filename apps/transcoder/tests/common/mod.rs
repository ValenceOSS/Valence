//! What every media test needs to find `FFmpeg` and build a fixture with it.
//!
//! Cargo compiles each file directly under `tests/` as its own binary, so anything they share has
//! to sit in a subdirectory or it becomes a test binary of its own. Before this existed the same
//! helpers were copied into ten files, three of them had drifted into asking for `ffmpeg` by name
//! rather than reading the variable, and the race in `generate` had to be fixed five times over.

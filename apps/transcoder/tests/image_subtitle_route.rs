//! What a real bitmap subtitle costs, and which route it actually takes.
//!
//! 1,156 of the 6,207 files in the reference library — 18.6% — carry PGS or
//! `VobSub`, and every one of them forces a burn-in: a bitmap subtitle cannot be
//! converted to text, so the picture has to be re-encoded with the subtitle
//! drawn onto it. That turns a free stream copy into a full video encode for
//! nearly a fifth of the library.
//!
//! `frame_route` already decides where that happens, and its unit tests cover
//! every branch. What they cover it with is a hand-written `SessionSpec`: the
//! `is_image_based` flag is set by the test rather than read off a file. This
//! drives the same decision from a real probe of a real bitmap-subtitle file,
//! so a change that made the probe and the router disagree would be caught.
//!
//! Then it runs the graph, and looks at the frames that come out. A route is
//! only worth choosing if it draws the subtitle, and that is not the same
//! question as whether `FFmpeg` accepted the arguments: the software route
//! overlaid the subtitle stream untouched, at its own canvas size, which put
//! the text below the picture on every file whose canvas was the larger of the
//! two. `FFmpeg` succeeded, segments were written, and the film came out of a
//! full re-encode with nothing drawn on it. Comparing against the same source
//! encoded without the subtitle is what catches that; nothing else here does.
//!
//! # The measurement
//!
//! Taken against the reference library itself rather than the corpus, because
//! the corpus fixtures are 23 KB near-static test patterns and an encode cost
//! measured on one would say nothing about a film. 25 files, stratified by
//! codec and resolution, 60 seconds of content from each, software `overlay`
//! into `libx264 -preset veryfast`, reading from a warm cache so the number is
//! processor time rather than network:
//!
//! | source | files | burn-in, relative to realtime |
//! | -- | -- | -- |
//! | 1080p H.264 | 3 | 13.5–15.8x |
//! | 1080p HEVC | 12 | 9.5–14.9x |
//! | 1080p AV1 | 6 | 11.1–12.3x |
//! | 2160p HEVC | 4 | 2.7–5.4x |
//!
//! The copy it replaces costs 0.09–0.42s for the same 60 seconds, so the
//! encode is between one and two orders of magnitude more expensive. It is
//! also, on every file measured, faster than the viewer watching it — which is
//! the question that decides whether 18.6% of the library is a problem. At
//! 1080p there is roughly a tenfold margin. At 2160p the margin is between
//! 2.7x and 5.4x, and that is the one to watch: it was measured as a single
//! stream on an idle machine, so a second concurrent 4K burn-in eats most of
//! what is left.
//!
//! Skips loudly when the corpus is absent. Build it with
//! `pnpm fixtures:sync --tier 1`.

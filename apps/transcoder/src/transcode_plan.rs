/// guessing would be worse than the honest bitrate they already get.

/// Intel's two need one thing more, because they pick a rate control mode out of the numbers rather
/// than being told one, and the mode they were landing on was the worst available. `VAAPI` tries
/// constant bitrate first where the ceiling equals the target, which is exactly what a capped
/// bitrate looks like — so every Intel transcode was encoded at a flat rate, spending the same
/// allocation on a still frame as on a snow storm. A demanding scene then has nothing to borrow and
/// visibly falls apart until it passes.
///
/// So the mode is stated. `VAAPI` takes `-rc_mode` outright; `QSV` has no such flag and is steered

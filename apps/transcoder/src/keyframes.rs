//! Where a film can be cut, and where its segments therefore fall.
//!
//! A segment has to begin at a keyframe. When Valence encodes it puts them where
//! it likes, so segments come out the length they were asked to be. When Valence
//! copies the video it has no such freedom: the keyframes are whatever the
//! source shipped with, and `-hls_time` is a request the muxer cannot honour.
//!
//! Measured on a Bluray remux of HEVC Main 10, keyframes ten to thirteen
//! seconds apart: a request for four second segments produced segments of
//! 13.2, 6.2, 6.0, 2.5, 7.9 and 7.6 seconds, and a fourteen megabyte first
//! segment that a browser has to fetch before it can show anything.
//!
//! The answer is not to force an encode. It is to know where the cuts actually
//! land and to say so, which is what segment addressing needs and
//! what Jellyfin does for the same case.

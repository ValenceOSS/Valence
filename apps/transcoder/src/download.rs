//! so it plays in whatever the device already has.
//!
//! The work is the same work a session does — the same encoder, the same
//! filters, the same decisions about what can be copied — so the arguments are
//! built from the same [`TranscodePlan`] rather than assembled again here. What
//! differs is the muxer, and what gets carried: a session sends one audio track
//! and leaves subtitles to a sidecar, where a file somebody keeps should hold
//! every track they might want, because there is nowhere to fetch a missing one
//! from at thirty thousand feet.

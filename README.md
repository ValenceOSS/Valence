# Valence

**A self hosted streaming platform for your own library.**

Your films and programmes, on every screen in the house, from a server you own.

## What it does

- **Plays what you already have.** Point it at a folder. It reads what is there,
  finds the artwork and the details, and leaves your files exactly as it found
  them. No sidecars, no renames, nothing written back.
- **Streams to anything.** Direct play where the device can take the file, and a
  transcode where it cannot, negotiated per device rather than per server.
- **Keeps HDR as HDR.** Tone mapping happens because a screen needs it, not
  because the transcoder gave up.
- **Household, not a single account.** Everybody gets a face, their own place in
  everything, and their own continue watching.
- **Watch together.** A party keeps everybody at the same moment in the same
  film, with the picture staying in step rather than drifting.
- **Take it with you.** Ask for a title at a chosen quality and keep it for a
  flight.
- **Share a link.** One title or one series, to somebody with no account, for as
  long as you decide.
- **An API you can build on.** Every endpoint has a contract, and the reference
  is generated from it and served by the server itself.

## Run it

The image carries the server, the web client and the media service.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarquesCoding/Valence/main/compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8420` and follow the setup.

Point it at your media by editing the mount in `compose.yaml`. It is mounted read
only, deliberately. [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) covers settings, a reverse
proxy, hardware transcoding and upgrades.

The full documentation, with install guides, a guide to every screen, developer
documentation and the interactive API reference, lives in `apps/docs`. Run it with
`pnpm --filter @valence/docs spec` followed by `pnpm --filter @valence/docs dev`.

## Develop it

```bash
pnpm install
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up -d db
pnpm ffmpeg:sync
pnpm dev
```

| Surface          | Address                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Web client       | http://localhost:5173                  |
| API              | http://localhost:8420/api              |
| API reference    | http://localhost:8420/api/reference    |
| OpenAPI document | http://localhost:8420/api/openapi.json |

`pnpm ffmpeg:sync` fetches the FFmpeg build Valence ships with. Skipping it works
but quietly costs you hardware encoding and HDR handling, because the FFmpeg on
your machine is unlikely to be the one Valence was built against.

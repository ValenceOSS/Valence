# Flux ships its own FFmpeg rather than relying on the host's.
#
# A build without libzimg cannot tone map HDR to SDR, and one without libass
# cannot draw text subtitles. Both failures are silent: the picture appears,
# looking washed out or missing its subtitles. Pinning the build is why
# FFmpeg is driven as a child process rather than linked.

# and this repository's are TypeScript path aliases pointing at other packages'
# sources — `@ValenceServer/...`, `@ValenceContracts/...` — which Node cannot
# resolve and which nothing rewrites. The emitted relative imports carry no file
# extension either, which ESM requires. Bundling settles both at build time and
# leaves node_modules external, so native dependencies are still loaded the

# Flux's own FFmpeg, at a version Flux chose, rather than whatever the base
# image happens to ship. Debian has no 8.x at all, and packages none of Intel's
# media stack — no libvpl, no vpl-gpu-rt, no iHD driver, in any release or
# component. It also drops QuickSync silently between bookworm and trixie, so a
# base image bump would have removed hardware encoding on Intel with nothing
# anywhere saying why.
#
# The package brings the drivers with it: iHD and i965 for Intel, radeonsi for
# AMD, all inside its own prefix. libva is patched at build time to look there
# first, so mesa-va-drivers is no longer installed — it only ever supplied
# radeonsi, and Debian's ffmpeg that needed it is gone.
#
# `pci.ids` is the table that turns 8086:4680 into "UHD Graphics 770". Only
# amdgpu writes its own name into sysfs, so without this an Intel card can be
# measured and not named, and the admin page would report a figure against a
# pair of hex numbers. About a megabyte, and it is the same table lspci reads.
#
# Downloaded with ADD rather than curl so the image needs no download tool of
# its own. Worth pinning `--checksum` here once the version settles.
# The build itself is published from a repository of its own and is still named for what it was
# called when it was set up. The name in these URLs and paths is that artefact's, not ours, and
# renaming it here would ask this image to fetch something that does not exist.

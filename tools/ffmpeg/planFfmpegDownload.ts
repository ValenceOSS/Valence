/**
 * Chooses which release artefact this machine needs, or says why there is not one.
 *
 * macOS takes the portable tarball and Linux the deb, because those are the two the fork builds.
 * The asymmetry is not an oversight: a Mac cannot use a deb at all, and it is the platform that
 * most needs its own build, since VideoToolbox cannot be reached from inside a container.
 *
 * Both Mac architectures are published. The Intel one is cross-compiled on an Apple silicon runner
 * and was measured on a 2015 MacBook Pro before being offered — the patched VideoToolbox filters
 * run on Iris Pro, which is a generation before Intel had HEVC at all and the oldest thing anybody
 * would reasonably retire into a media server.
 *
 * @param options - What this machine is, and which version is pinned.
 * @returns Where to fetch the artefact, or the reason there is none to fetch.

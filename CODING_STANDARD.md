# Valence Code Standards

These rules are binding. They are enforced by tooling wherever a rule can be
expressed as a lint rule, and by review where it cannot. A pull request that
violates a rule here does not merge, regardless of how good the change is
otherwise.

Where a rule has a known cost, that cost is stated. Rules are not folklore.

---

## 1. Languages

**TypeScript and Rust only. No JavaScript.**

This includes configuration. Build config, scripts, tooling, and lint config are
authored in TypeScript (`vite.config.ts`, `eslint.config.ts`, `scripts/*.ts`)
and executed via `tsx` where a runtime needs them. Where a tool physically
cannot load TypeScript config, the generated JavaScript is a build artifact and
is `.gitignore`d, never hand-edited.

No `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` files are committed to the repository.

---

## 2. No duplication across modules

If a function, type, constant, or component is needed in more than one place, it
is extracted and shared. Copy-paste between `apps/`, `packages/`, or platforms is
not acceptable.

Where shared code lives:

| Shared between                           | Goes in                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Any two workspace members                | `packages/contracts` (types, schemas) |
| Any two UI surfaces                      | `packages/ui`                         |
| Server-only helpers used by two services | `packages/core`                       |
| Plugin-facing anything                   | `packages/plugin-sdk`                 |

The dependency rules still apply: extraction must not create a
cycle. If extracting would create one, the shared thing belongs further up the
graph, usually in `contracts`.

**Rust:** shared logic lives in a workspace crate, not duplicated between
binaries. Same principle, same enforcement.

---

## 3. Imports

**Relative parent imports are banned.** `../`, `../../`, and deeper never appear
in an import specifier.

```ts
import Button from '@ValenceUI/Button'; // correct
import Button from '../../ui/Button/Button'; // banned
```

Same-directory relative imports (`./Button.types`) are permitted, because a
component importing its own co-located types is not crossing a boundary.

### Alias map

| Alias                 | Resolves to                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@ValenceUI/<Name>`   | `packages/ui/src/components/<Name>/<Name>.tsx` |
| `@ValenceContracts/*` | `packages/contracts/src/*`                     |
| `@ValenceCore/*`      | `packages/core/src/*`                          |
| `@ValenceSDK/*`       | `packages/plugin-sdk/src/*`                    |

### How `@ValenceUI/Button` resolves without index files

TypeScript path mapping substitutes a wildcard once, so `@ValenceUI/*` cannot expand
to `components/*/*.tsx` — the captured segment would need to appear twice. Since
rule 4 also forbids barrel files, there is no `index.ts` to fall back on.

Component aliases are therefore **listed explicitly, one line per component**, in
`tsconfig.paths.json` at the repository root:

```json
{
  "@ValenceUI/Button": ["./packages/ui/src/components/Button/Button.tsx"],
  "@ValenceUI/Checkbox": ["./packages/ui/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx"]
}
```

Adding a component means adding one line here. It is a one-line diff, visible in
review, and it keeps resolution explicit and greppable without reintroducing
barrels. The non-component packages keep ordinary wildcard aliases, which work
because their paths do not repeat a segment.

Vitest and Vite read these through `vite-tsconfig-paths`, so there is a single
source of truth rather than a duplicated alias list per bundler config.

### Published package names

`@ValenceUI` is an internal alias only. npm scopes must be lowercase, so any package
published to a registry uses a lowercase name (`@valence/ui`, `@valence/plugin-sdk`).
The alias and the published name are deliberately different things; do not try to
make them match.

---

## 4. No index files

`index.ts` and `index.tsx` are not used to re-export functions or components
anywhere in the repository. Every module is imported from the file that defines
it.

This means no barrel files, no `export * from`, and no directory-level public
surface. It costs slightly longer import paths and buys precise dependency
graphs, faster type-checking, and no accidental circular imports through a
barrel.

---

## 5. Exports

**Every component and function file exports its members by name:**

```tsx
const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  return <BaseButton className={...}>{props.children}</BaseButton>
}

Button.displayName = 'Button'

export { Button }
```

Consumption — **import what is used, and nothing else**:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ValenceUI/Button';

const MediaCard = (props: MediaCardProps) => {
  return <Button variant="primary">Play</Button>;
};
```

No default exports, and no module objects. A file exports the thing it is named
after; a caller names the thing it needs. Nothing has to be unwrapped at the top
of a file before it can be used, and nothing has to be renamed to avoid a
collision between two modules called the same.

Type-only exports (`export type { ButtonProps }`) sit alongside the value
exports and are erased at runtime.

One exported runtime member per file, with the file named after it. Constants
that belong to that member — a delay, a limit, a list of options it is built
from — may be exported beside it where tests or callers genuinely need them.

### What this replaces

Until August 2026 every file default-exported an object naming its member, and
every caller imported the module and destructured it. That form was chosen to
make the exported surface explicit; in practice it cost more than it bought.

**What the change buys.** React Fast Refresh works again: a component inside an
object literal cannot be tracked, so every edit remounted the subtree and lost
local state — a player forgot its position on each keystroke. `React.lazy` works
directly, so the `lazyValence` helper that existed only to unwrap a default is
gone. `displayName` remains required, but for its own sake rather than to repair
a name the convention had erased.

**What it costs.** A single sweeping change to every file in the repository,
which is a large diff and a bad day for anybody rebasing across it. That cost is
paid once.

This rule is enforced: `import/no-default-export` is on in oxlint, with an
exception for the config files that tooling insists on reading a default from.

### The tooling note that survives it

`apps/server/src/db/Schema.ts` exports each table by name because drizzle-kit
discovers tables by scanning a module's named exports; given anything else it
reports `0 tables` and generates an empty migration, silently. Under this rule
that file is no longer an exception — it is simply the rule applied.

### A migration written by hand still needs a snapshot

`drizzle-kit generate` diffs the schema against the newest snapshot in
`apps/server/drizzle/meta`, so a migration written by hand — which is the usual
way one gets written here — leaves no snapshot and the next generation diffs
against a stale one. It then writes SQL that recreates every table added since,
plausibly enough to be committed and destructively enough to fail on the first
`CREATE TABLE`. This is not theoretical: snapshots `0039`, `0040` and `0043` to
`0048` were absent, and generation had been wrong for six migrations before
anyone ran it (VAL-193).

So: write the SQL by hand where that is clearer, then run
`pnpm --filter @valence/server db:generate` and commit **the snapshot it leaves**
while discarding the SQL it writes. `pnpm db:check` fails when the two are out of
step, and CI runs it.

---

## 6. Comments

**No comments in the codebase, with these exceptions:**

1. **TSDoc on functions and components — and on nothing else.** Required on
   anything exported from `packages/plugin-sdk` or `packages/contracts`, because
   those generate public documentation.

   **One sentence saying what the function does.** Not why it was written that
   way, not what was tried before, not what the alternative would have cost. A
   summary, and then `@param` and `@returns` where the name and the type do not
   already say it — a `@param mediaId` on `(mediaId: string)` is the signature
   read aloud, and adds nothing.

   **Types, constants, properties and interfaces carry no TSDoc at all.** A
   type says what it is by being a type with a name; a constant says it by
   being named. If either needs a paragraph to be understood, the name is
   wrong, and renaming it fixes every place it is read rather than one.

2. **Rust doc comments** (`///`, `//!`) on public items, for the same reason.
3. **`// SAFETY:` on every `unsafe` block in Rust.** This is required by
   `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`, which is enabled. A rule that fights the
   linter is a rule that gets disabled, so this exception exists by necessity.
4. **Lint suppression directives** (`// eslint-disable-next-line`,
   `#[allow(...)]`). These are instructions to tooling, not commentary. Each
   requires a reason string, and each is reviewed as a change in its own right.

Everything else — explanatory comments, section banners, commented-out code,
`TODO`, `FIXME` — is rejected. If code needs explanation, the explanation belongs
in a name, a type, or a TSDoc block. If work is outstanding, it belongs in an
issue where it can be tracked, not in a comment where it cannot.

### How this is enforced

Two checks, because no one linter reads every language here.

`valence/no-comments` in `tools/eslint/noComments.ts` covers TypeScript. It fails
on any comment that is not one of the exceptions above, and removes it under
`--fix`. TSDoc counts only when it sits on a function — a declaration, a method,
or a `const` holding an arrow function. On a type, a constant or a property it is
rejected, and a `/** */` block floating inside a function body is prose in a
costume and rejected as prose.
A third slash means `/// <reference>` and nothing else: `/// prose` is Rust
syntax in the wrong language, and is rejected too.

`tools/comments/checkComments.ts` covers Rust and CSS, which ESLint cannot see
at all. It parses rather than pattern-matches, so a `//` inside a string literal
stays where it is. Both run under `pnpm lint`, which runs on every commit.

The rule also fails a lint directive that does not say why, after `--`.

This is a rule that was written down and then ignored for a year, by people and
by coding agents alike. Documentation does not enforce itself; a failing build
does.

## 7. Naming and file layout

**Files are PascalCase**, except type files and standalone function files.

| Kind                | Casing              | Example                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Component           | PascalCase          | `MediaCard.tsx`          |
| Component types     | PascalCase + suffix | `MediaCard.types.ts`     |
| Component test      | PascalCase + suffix | `MediaCard.test.tsx`     |
| Hook                | camelCase           | `usePlaybackSession.ts`  |
| Standalone function | camelCase           | `formatDuration.ts`      |
| Function test       | camelCase + suffix  | `formatDuration.test.ts` |
| Rust module         | snake_case          | `transcode_plan.rs`      |

A component's types live with the component, never in a shared types directory:

```
components/MediaCard/
  MediaCard.tsx
  MediaCard.types.ts
  MediaCard.test.tsx
  animations/
    fadeIn.tsx
  components/
    MediaCardBadge/
      MediaCardBadge.tsx
      MediaCardBadge.types.ts
      MediaCardBadge.test.tsx
```

Sub-components nest under the parent's `components/` directory to arbitrary
depth. A sub-component used by two different parents is not a sub-component — it
is promoted to a top-level component under rule 2.

Types shared across components live in `packages/contracts`.

---

## 8. Types

**`any`, `unknown`, and type assertions are all banned.**

`as` is included because banning `unknown` without banning `as` would push
untrusted data through unchecked casts, which is strictly less safe than the
thing being banned. The two rules only work together.

Permitted: `as const`, and `satisfies`.

### How to handle untrusted input without either

Untrusted data enters through a Zod schema, which produces a concrete type
without any annotation being written:

```ts
const item = MediaItemSchema.parse(JSON.parse(body));
```

`JSON.parse` returns `any`, but no `any` token appears in the source and the
result is runtime-validated before it is used. This is the required pattern for
every external boundary: HTTP bodies, plugin RPC payloads, file metadata,
transcoder output, and anything read from disk.

### Errors

Do not annotate the catch variable. TypeScript infers it, and `instanceof`
narrows it without a cast:

```ts
try {
  await startSession(plan);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof TranscodeError) {
    return failure(error.code);
  }
  throw error;
}
```

`useUnknownInCatchVariables` is enabled in `tsconfig`, alongside `strict`,
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

---

## 9. UI components

**Raw HTML form and interactive elements are banned outside the one ValenceUI
component that owns each of them.** No `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`,
`<textarea>`, `<a>` used as a control, `<dialog>` or `<iframe>` — not in
application code, and not in other ValenceUI components either.

Structural elements — `<div>`, `<span>`, `<section>`, `<ul>` — are fine.

### One component owns each primitive

| Primitive                                           | Owned by        | Everything else          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| `<button>`                                          | `Button`        | composes `Button`        |
| `<input type="text\|email\|password\|url\|search">` | `TextField`     | composes `TextField`     |
| `<input type="file">`                               | `FilePicker`    | composes `FilePicker`    |
| `<dialog>`, focus trapping                          | `Dialog`        | composes `Dialog`        |
| `<iframe>`                                          | `EmbeddedVideo` | composes `EmbeddedVideo` |

**A control that is not one of those is a shape of one of those.** An icon
button is `Button` with an icon and a label. A search box is `TextField` wearing
no box. A row of page markers, a bar of places, a menu of settings: all
`Button`, painted differently.

There is no `IconButton`, and there should be no equivalent of one for any other
primitive. A second component wrapping the same element is a second set of focus
behaviour, disabled behaviour and keyboard behaviour — written slightly
differently, drifting apart from the first, and each fixed separately when
either turns out to be wrong.

### Widening a component rather than escaping it

When a control needs something the owning component does not offer, **add it to
that component**. `Button` carries `variant="bare"` and `size="none"` for
exactly this: the controls ValenceUI builds out of it need a button's behaviour and
none of its skin.

`bare` and `none` are for a control that supplies its own shape: a card that is
one big press target, an episode row, the clock in the player. They say _this
one is painted by its caller_ — not _this one is exempt_. A control that wants a
skin ValenceUI does not have wants a variant that ought to exist by name; add it,
and say what it is for.

**If ValenceUI lacks a component you need, add it to ValenceUI.** A one-off raw
control in an app is how design systems die; a second component owning the same
element is how they rot.

### Base UI owns behaviour; ValenceUI owns appearance

If Base UI ships a primitive for what you are building, build on it. Roles,
keyboard handling, focus management and ARIA wiring are a contract with the
browser and with assistive technology, and hand-rolling them produces something
that looks right and is subtly wrong — a `div` with a bar in it instead of a
meter, a button with `role="switch"` that a keyboard cannot toggle.

**Only `packages/ui` imports Base UI.** An app that imports it directly has
reached past the layer whose whole job is to be the one place a control is
decided. If ValenceUI lacks the component, add it to ValenceUI.

Judgement still applies. A primitive earns its place by doing something for you:
`Field` was worth adopting because it owns label, description, error and the
wiring between them. `FilePicker`'s `<label>` was not, because there the label
_is_ the mechanism that opens the file browser, and wrapping it in a `Field.Root`
would add a DOM node to satisfy a library rather than a reader.

### A look is a variant, not a class at the call site

`className` on a ValenceUI component is for _where a thing sits_ — width, margin,
grid placement. It is not for what the thing looks like.

Four call sites once wrote `className="bg-black/50 text-white backdrop-blur"` on
a `Button`. That is one look, described four times, in raw colours no theme can
reach. It is now `variant="overlay"`, painted from `--color-scrim` and
`--color-on-scrim`.

When a control needs a look the component does not offer:

1. Name the look — what is it _for_, not what colour is it. `overlay` is for a
   control on artwork; `link` is text that leads somewhere.
2. Add it to the component's variant list, in tokens rather than literal
   colours.
3. Use it everywhere that look appears.

A theme can only move what is named. `bg-black/50` at a call site is invisible
to it, and every one of those is a place a future theme will be wrong.

### How this is enforced

ESLint fails the build on `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`,
`<dialog>` and `<iframe>` anywhere in the repo. The exceptions are listed by
filename in `eslint.config.ts`: the components that own those elements, and test
files, where a raw element stands in for an arbitrary caller-supplied child.

Adding a filename to that list is not how you satisfy the rule. The list grows
only when a new primitive gets an owner.

---

## 10. Icons

**All icons come from `@keyline-icons/react`, and are drawn by
`@ValenceUI/Icon`.** Phosphor, Remix Icon, Tabler, Lucide and Hugeicons are all banned in ESLint, so a
second set cannot come back a file at a time. A call site names the icon it wants, aliased with
an `Icon` suffix so it never shadows anything else in the file, and `Icon` decides how it is
drawn, which is what keeps the set swappable in one file.

An icon that is not the colour of the text around it is given a `tone` (`strong`, `muted`,
`faint` or `danger`) rather than a colour in `className`. `className` on an icon is for where
it sits. ESLint fails the build on a text colour in an icon's `className`.

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@ValenceUI/Icon';
import { Home as HomeIcon } from '@keyline-icons/react';
import { Home as HomeFilledIcon } from '@keyline-icons/react/fill';

<Icon of={HomeIcon} whenActive={HomeFilledIcon} isActive={isCurrent} size={18} />;
```

**`apps/landing` is the one exception, and draws from `@tabler/icons-react`
directly instead.** getvalence.app is a marketing page rather than the
product, and wants brand icons no product set has. A landing component imports
a Tabler icon and renders it itself where it needs one. `eslint.config.ts` scopes the ban accordingly: `apps/landing/src`
keeps every other rule in this section, Tabler included, everywhere else
still refuses it.

**Say "this one is selected" with the filled twin, not with a different glyph.** Every
icon has a fill drawing under the same name in `@keyline-icons/react/fill`, and `whenActive`
is where it goes: `isActive` swaps it in place. Reaching for a different glyph to mean selected
is how a section turns into a camcorder.

**Every active item is solid, and so is the main action.** A nav item, sidebar item, favourite,
toggle or any button in its on state draws the filled twin, through `whenActive` (or `litGlyph`
on a `BarButton`). Play, pause and skip always draw solid, and so does any icon inside a primary
or confirm button, so the action that matters reads heavier than the ones around it.

**No raw SVG anywhere in the codebase.** No inline `<svg>` elements, no
`.svg` imported as a component, no SVG strings.

The sole exception is brand assets — logo, wordmark, favicon — which live as
files in `packages/ui/assets/brand/` and are referenced by URL, never inlined
into JSX. That exception also covers the marks the icon set does not draw: it
has no brand glyphs, so a browser or a service is named in words or given a
generic shape rather than approximated with the nearest thing.

---

## 11. Animation

**Motion (`motion`, formerly `framer-motion`) is preferred over raw CSS
animations and transitions.** Declarative, interruptible, and testable beats
keyframes.

Placement:

| Scope                                    | Location                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Used once, inside one component          | Inline in that component                       |
| Shared across files within one component | `components/ComponentName/animations/spin.tsx` |
| Shared across multiple components        | `packages/ui/animations/spin.tsx`              |

CSS transitions remain acceptable for trivial hover and focus states where
Motion would be overhead. Anything with orchestration, sequencing, layout
animation, enter/exit, or gesture response uses Motion.

**Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.** Every shared animation exports a
reduced-motion variant, and the shared `useValenceMotion` hook selects between
them. This is not optional; it is an accessibility requirement.

---

## 12. Testing

**Every function and every component is tested. Vitest, co-located.**

```
components/MediaCard/MediaCard.test.tsx
functions/formatDuration.test.ts
```

- Components use Vitest + React Testing Library. Query by role and accessible
  name, not by test id or class. If a component is hard to query by role, that is
  usually an accessibility defect in the component, not a testing problem.
- Coverage thresholds are enforced in CI and are not lowered to make a build
  pass. Raising them is a PR of its own.
- Rust code is tested with `cargo test`. Negotiation logic in particular is
  tested as pure functions over data: no media files, no FFmpeg.
- Tests that need media fixtures skip with an actionable
  message when the tier is absent. CI asserts the expected tiers were present.

---

## 13. Commits

**Conventional Commits, enforced by `commitlint` at the `commit-msg` hook.**

```
feat(transcoder): preserve HDR10 metadata through transcode
fix(ui): correct MediaCard focus ring in dark theme
chore(deps): pin better-auth to 1.4.2
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`,
`ci`, `style`, `revert`.

Scopes are workspace module names: `web`, `server`, `transcoder`, `ui`,
`contracts`, `plugin-sdk`, `docs`.

Breaking changes use `!` and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. For anything affecting
the API contract or a plugin extension point, this is
mandatory and drives the changelog.

---

## 14. Enforcement

**oxlint** runs first for
speed and owns all non-type-aware rules; **ESLint** owns only rules requiring the
type checker; **husky** blocks anything non-conforming before it reaches the
remote.

Where a rule maps onto an existing lint rule, it is configured and enforced.
Rules with no upstream equivalent — no comments, no index files, export shape,
no raw elements, no SVG — are **documented here and upheld in review**. This
document is the reference; when a review comment cites a rule, it cites a section
number from this file.

### A rule that is off, and why

`react/set-state-in-effect` is disabled in `.oxlintrc.json`. It arrived with
oxlint 1 and reported thirty-seven findings. Thirty-six of them were correct
code.

The rule cannot see a cleanup function, so it reads four patterns this codebase
is built on as mistakes. A timer that resets its state before arming itself and
clears it on the way out. A subscription to something outside React — a
reachability listener, a scroll observer, a `fullscreenchange` handler — which
is the case the rule's own help text says an effect is _for_. A fetch that
clears, loads and guards against arriving after unmount. And a draft derived
from a prop, where a dialog fills its form when the thing it is editing changes.

The thirty-seventh was real: `MediaCard` probed the pointer on mount and set
state from the result, which renders once with the wrong answer and then again
with the right one. That is now a lazy `useState` initialiser and the effect
is gone.

Leaving the rule on would mean rewriting working timers, subscriptions and
loaders across the video player, the watch party and the shell to satisfy an
analysis that cannot model them, and reviewing eighty-eight warnings a week in
the hope of noticing the one that matters. Section 6 already names the
principle: a rule that fights the linter is a rule that gets disabled. This is
that, pointed the other way.
